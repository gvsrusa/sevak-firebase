## Prompt [LS2_PRD_Glossary_Typos]

### Context
The PRD document ([`docs/Zero-Code User Blueprint for SPARC Program Generator.md`](docs/Zero-Code%20User%20Blueprint%20for%20SPARC%20Program%20Generator.md:0)) has critical deficiencies in its glossary and contains unresolved typographical errors, as detailed in [`reflection_LS2.md`](reflection_LS2.md:8) (Issue 1). The `glossary_completeness_score` is 30/100 and `typo_resolution_score` is 20/100, indicating these issues were not addressed from `reflection_LS1.md`.

### Objective
To achieve full clarity and professionalism in the PRD by ensuring all technical terms and acronyms are defined and all typographical errors, especially "Al" for "AI", are corrected.

### Focus Areas
-   Section 1.5 (Glossary) of [`docs/Zero-Code User Blueprint for SPARC Program Generator.md`](docs/Zero-Code%20User%20Blueprint%20for%20SPARC%20Program%20Generator.md:0).
-   First use of all acronyms throughout the document.
-   Specific instances of "Al" on lines 11 and 83 of [`docs/Zero-Code User Blueprint for SPARC Program Generator.md`](docs/Zero-Code%20User%20Blueprint%20for%20SPARC%20Program%20Generator.md:0) and any other occurrences.
-   Overall document proofreading for typos.

### Code Reference
N/A (This is a documentation task. Refer to [`reflection_LS2.md`](reflection_LS2.md:20) for examples of undefined terms and [`reflection_LS2.md`](reflection_LS2.md:16) for "Al" typo locations).

### Requirements
1.  **Mandatory Glossary Expansion**: Update Section 1.5 of the PRD to include clear, concise definitions for **ALL** technical acronyms and specialized terms listed in [`reflection_LS2.md`](reflection_LS2.md:22) (BMS, MCU, UI/UX, SDK, MTBF, NPS, A*, COTS, DFMA, LiFePO4, NMC, TCP/IP, UDP, MQTT, BLE, API, QSG, i18n, l10n, PK, FK, UUID, PCL, SLAM, AMCL, AI/ML) and any others present.
2.  **Mandatory First Use Definition**: For every acronym, ensure it is defined in parentheses upon its first appearance in the document if not already covered by the glossary expansion.
3.  **Mandatory "Al" to "AI" Correction**: Correct "Al" to "AI" on lines 11 and 83 of the PRD and conduct a full document search to correct any other instances.
4.  **Mandatory Full Typo Sweep**: Perform a thorough proofread of the entire PRD document ([`docs/Zero-Code User Blueprint for SPARC Program Generator.md`](docs/Zero-Code%20User%20Blueprint%20for%20SPARC%20Program%20Generator.md:0)) and correct all typographical and grammatical errors.

### Expected Improvements
-   `glossary_completeness_score` to reach at least 85.
-   `typo_resolution_score` to reach at least 90.
-   Significant improvement in overall document clarity and professionalism.

## Prompt [LS2_PRD_Formatting_Consistency]

### Context
Persistent formatting inconsistencies remain in the PRD document ([`docs/Zero-Code User Blueprint for SPARC Program Generator.md`](docs/Zero-Code%20User%20Blueprint%20for%20SPARC%20Program%20Generator.md:0)), as detailed in [`reflection_LS2.md`](reflection_LS2.md:31) (Issue 2). The `formatting_consistency_score` is only 40/100.

### Objective
To ensure consistent and professional formatting throughout the PRD, enhancing readability and adherence to standard Markdown practices.

### Focus Areas
-   List formatting (bullet characters, indentation) throughout [`docs/Zero-Code User Blueprint for SPARC Program Generator.md`](docs/Zero-Code%20User%20Blueprint%20for%20SPARC%20Program%20Generator.md:0).
-   Heading styles in Section 10 of [`docs/Zero-Code User Blueprint for SPARC Program Generator.md`](docs/Zero-Code%20User%20Blueprint%20for%20SPARC%20Program%20Generator.md:0).

### Code Reference
N/A (This is a documentation task. Refer to [`reflection_LS2.md`](reflection_LS2.md:36) for an example of problematic Section 10 formatting).

### Requirements
1.  **Mandatory Standardized List Formatting**:
    *   Choose **ONE** bullet character (`*` or `-`) and apply it consistently in the Markdown source for all lists in the PRD.
    *   Ensure **UNIFORM** indentation (e.g., 4 spaces per level) for all list levels, including nested lists, throughout the PRD.
2.  **Mandatory Reformatting of Section 10 Headings**: All main topics within Section 10 of the PRD (e.g., "Sensor Suite Optimization," "Path Planning Algorithm") **MUST** be reformatted to use H3 (`###`) Markdown headings (e.g., `### 10.1 Sensor Suite Optimization`).

### Expected Improvements
-   `formatting_consistency_score` to reach at least 85.
-   Improved document structure and readability.

## Prompt [LS2_PRD_TBD_Resolution]

### Context
Numerous "TBD" (To Be Determined) items persist in core sections of the PRD document ([`docs/Zero-Code User Blueprint for SPARC Program Generator.md`](docs/Zero-Code%20User%20Blueprint%20for%20SPARC%20Program%20Generator.md:0)), severely impacting its actionability. This is detailed in [`reflection_LS2.md`](reflection_LS2.md:47) (Issue 3). The `tbd_resolution_clarity_score` is 40/100, and `readiness_for_development_score` is 55/100.

### Objective
To eliminate ambiguity and make the PRD fully actionable by resolving all "TBD" items or replacing them with clear, accountable placeholders.

### Focus Areas
-   All instances of "TBD" or similar placeholders (e.g., "pending team decision") within [`docs/Zero-Code User Blueprint for SPARC Program Generator.md`](docs/Zero-Code%20User%20Blueprint%20for%20SPARC%20Program%20Generator.md:0). Refer to locations itemized in [`reflection_LS1.md`](reflection_LS1.md:40) and conduct a full document search.

### Code Reference
N/A (This is a documentation task. Refer to [`reflection_LS2.md`](reflection_LS2.md:52) for an example of a TBD item).

### Requirements
1.  **Mandatory Resolution or Definition**: For **EVERY** "TBD" or pending decision point in the PRD:
    *   Resolve the item with a specific decision or defined parameter.
2.  **Mandatory Actionable Placeholders**: If a final decision cannot be made in this iteration, the "TBD" **MUST** be replaced with an actionable placeholder that clearly specifies:
    *   **WHO** is responsible for the decision (e.g., "Decision Owner: Lead Engineer").
    *   **BY WHEN** the decision is expected (e.g., "Due: Sprint 2 Planning").
    *   A **DIRECT REFERENCE** to the specific discussion in Section 10 if it provides a V1 recommendation (e.g., "V1 design recommendation: Rotary Mower, see Section 10.3.").
    *   Generic "TBD" entries are no longer acceptable.

### Expected Improvements
-   `tbd_resolution_clarity_score` to reach at least 85.
-   `readiness_for_development_score` to reach at least 85.
-   PRD becomes a clear and actionable guide for development.

## Prompt [LS2_PRD_Section10_Status_Clarity]

### Context
The "Status: Addressed" label used in Section 10 of the PRD document ([`docs/Zero-Code User Blueprint for SPARC Program Generator.md`](docs/Zero-Code%20User%20Blueprint%20for%20SPARC%20Program%20Generator.md:0)) can be misinterpreted, as noted in [`reflection_LS2.md`](reflection_LS2.md:63) (Issue 4). This was a recommended fix in LS1 that needs implementation.

### Objective
To improve the clarity of status reporting for open issues discussed in Section 10 of the PRD.

### Focus Areas
-   The "Status:" line for each item discussed in Section 10 of [`docs/Zero-Code User Blueprint for SPARC Program Generator.md`](docs/Zero-Code%20User%20Blueprint%20for%20SPARC%20Program%20Generator.md:0).

### Code Reference
N/A (This is a documentation task. Refer to [`reflection_LS2.md`](reflection_LS2.md:68) for an example of the current status line).

### Requirements
1.  **Mandatory Status Label Refinement**: For each item in Section 10, replace the current "Status: Addressed" line. **CHOOSE ONE** of the following options (or a similarly unambiguous phrasing) and apply it consistently:
    *   "Status: Discussed & V1 Recommendations Provided"
    *   "Status: V1 Approach Defined in PRD"
    *   "Status: Analysis Complete; V1 Path Forward Documented"

### Expected Improvements
-   Improved clarity and reduced potential for misinterpretation of Section 10 items.
-   Better alignment of reader understanding with the actual state of issue resolution within the PRD.
