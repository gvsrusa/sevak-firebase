      "summary": "Comprehensive Summary for \"Mobile App Status Monitoring\" Feature Implementation:\n\n1. Initial Context Gathering and Orchestration Setup:\n\nThe orchestration for the \"Mobile App Status Monitoring\" feature commenced by reviewing the project's state via the [`.memory`](.memory) and [`.docsregistry`](.docsregistry) files. Key signals indicated the completion of prior phases, including SPARC specification, framework scaffolding for the mobile PWA, and, crucially, the generation of a granular test plan ([`docs/tests/granular_test_plans/mobile_app_status_monitoring_test_plan.md`](docs/tests/granular_test_plans/mobile_app_status_monitoring_test_plan.md)) and corresponding test code ([`mobile-app/__tests__/status_monitoring.test.tsx`](mobile-app/__tests__/status_monitoring.test.tsx)).\n\nThe [`docs/PRDMasterPlan.md`](docs/PRDMasterPlan.md) (specifically section 5.C.1) defines this feature's requirement: \"Display real-time tractor data: location, current action (idle, cutting, transporting, charging, error, manual mode, E-Stop), battery level, connectivity status.\" The target for implementation is the [`mobile-app/components/StatusDisplay.tsx`](mobile-app/components/StatusDisplay.tsx) component. This feature directly supports the high-level acceptance test `UIX-002: Real-time Tractor Status Display` outlined in [`docs/tests/high_level_acceptance_tests/task_management_ui_ux.md`](docs/tests/high_level_acceptance_tests/task_management_ui_ux.md). The [`docs/architecture/system_architecture.md`](docs/architecture/system_architecture.md) further details the `StatusDisplay` components as part of the UI/UX layer, responsible for presenting this real-time data.\n\nThe primary objective for this orchestration cycle was to manage the Test-Driven Development (TDD) implementation of this feature, ensuring all granular tests pass and a thorough self-reflection on code quality is performed by the coder.\n\n2. Coder Task Delegation and Outcome (Attempt 1):\n\nA task was delegated to the `coder-test-driven` mode to enhance the [`mobile-app/components/StatusDisplay.tsx`](mobile-app/components/StatusDisplay.tsx) component to meet the requirements and pass all tests in [`mobile-app/__tests__/status_monitoring.test.tsx`](mobile-app/__tests__/status_monitoring.test.tsx).\n\n*   **Coder's Summary of Work:**\n    The coder reviewed the requirements in [`docs/PRDMasterPlan.md`](docs/PRDMasterPlan.md) and [`docs/architecture/system_architecture.md`](docs/architecture/system_architecture.md), and analyzed the existing tests and component code. A minor enhancement was made to the `StatusDisplayProps` interface in [`mobile-app/components/StatusDisplay.tsx`](mobile-app/components/StatusDisplay.tsx) by changing the `status` prop type from a specific union (`'loading' | 'online' | 'offline' | 'error'`) to `string`. This change was made to more accurately reflect the component's behavior, which includes a `default` case in its `switch` statement to handle any string input, aligning with the test for an \"unknown\" status. Consequently, an `// @ts-expect-error` comment in [`mobile-app/__tests__/status_monitoring.test.tsx`](mobile-app/__tests__/status_monitoring.test.tsx) was removed as it was no longer necessary. The coder confirmed that the component now correctly handles the statuses defined in the tests and is robust in handling unknown status strings by displaying \"Status: Unknown\".\n\n*   **Coder's Self-Reflection:**\n    *   **Code Quality:** The component remains small, focused, and clear. The type change for the `status` prop to `string` improved type accuracy. Efficiency is high due to lightweight rendering logic. Modularity is maintained. LoC changed: 1 line modified in component, 1 comment line removed in tests. Cyclomatic complexity remains low.\n    *   **Security:** No security vulnerabilities were introduced; the component is presentational and React's default XSS protection applies.\n    *   **Performance:** No discernible performance impact.\n    *   **Maintainability:** The code is straightforward. The `string` type for `status` with a `default` case enhances robustness by gracefully handling unexpected status values.\n    *   **Problematic Fallbacks:** No problematic fallbacks were implemented; \"Status: Unknown\" is an explicit and informative fallback.\n\n*   **Verification of AI Verifiable Outcomes:**\n    *   **Test Results:** The test runner output for the command `cd mobile-app && npm test mobile-app/__tests__/status_monitoring.test.tsx` was provided and confirmed:\n        ```\n        PASS  __tests__/status_monitoring.test.tsx\n          StatusDisplay Component\n            ✓ renders correctly (11 ms)\n            ✓ displays \"Loading...\" status (2 ms)\n            ✓ displays \"Online\" status (1 ms)\n            ✓ displays \"Offline\" status (1 ms)\n            ✓ displays \"Error\" status with default message (2 ms)\n            ✓ displays \"Error\" status with custom message (1 ms)\n            ✓ displays \"Unknown\" status for unhandled status prop\n\n        Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total\n        Tests:       7 passed, 7 total\n        Snapshots:   0 total\n        Time:        0.633 s, estimated 1 s\n        Ran all test suites matching /mobile-app\\/__tests__\\/status_monitoring.test/i.\n        ```\n        All 7 tests passed, satisfying the primary AI verifiable outcome.\n    *   **Self-Reflection Report:** The coder provided a comprehensive self-reflection report, satisfying the secondary AI verifiable outcome.\n\n3. Final Quality Assessment and Handoff:\n\nThe \"Mobile App Status Monitoring\" feature implementation was successful in its first attempt. The code changes were minimal but improved type accuracy and robustness. All granular tests passed, and the coder's self-reflection indicates good quality, security, performance, and maintainability. No further debugging or refinement cycles are required for this feature based on the current scope and test outcomes.\n\nThis comprehensive natural language summary details the collective outcomes for human review and is intended for the Scribe to update the [`.memory`](.memory) and [`.docsregistry`](.docsregistry) files, reflecting the feature's development and quality status relative to [`docs/PRDMasterPlan.md`](docs/PRDMasterPlan.md)."

This feature supports high-level acceptance tests related to UI/UX and manual operation capabilities. The [`docs/architecture/system_architecture.md`](docs/architecture/system_architecture.md) provides further context on where this component fits within the mobile application's UI layer.\n\nThe primary objective for this orchestration cycle was to manage the Test-Driven Development (TDD) implementation of this feature, ensuring all 14 granular tests in [`mobile-app/__tests__/manual_control.test.tsx`](mobile-app/__tests__/manual_control.test.tsx) pass and a thorough self-reflection on code quality is performed by the coder.\n\n**2.

It integrates with the `TractorCommunicationService` for sending movement and mechanism control commands, and subscribes to `TractorStatusService` for real-time status updates. UI elements for joystick interaction (simulated via buttons in tests) and mechanism control were implemented. The component ensures movement commands respect the `MANUAL_MODE_SPEED` constant.\n    *   **Test File Adaptation:**\n        *   The test file, [`mobile-app/__tests__/manual_control.test.tsx`](mobile-app/__tests__/manual_control.test.tsx), was updated to import and test the actual `ManualControlScreen` component. Jest mocks for the new services were refined, addressing hoisting issues by using a shared state object for mock factories and `jest.requireActual` for importing `act`.\n    *   **Iterative Development:** The coder followed a TDD approach, iteratively running tests and refining the implementation until all 14 tests passed.\n\n*   **Coder's Self-Reflection:**\n    *   **Code Quality:**\n        *   Clarity: Code is described as straightforward, with React state and effects for service interactions. Services have clear responsibilities.\n        *   Modularity: Good separation into component and services.\n        *   LoC Created: `TractorCommunicationService.ts` (~20 LoC), `TractorStatusService.ts` (~67 LoC), `ManualControlScreen.tsx` (~137 LoC). `manual_control.test.tsx` was significantly refactored (~250 LoC).\n        *   Cyclomatic Complexity: Estimated low for `ManualControlScreen.tsx` (main body < 10, handlers 1-2 each).\n    *   **Security:** The component relies on `TractorCommunicationService` for secure transmission; no direct security features in the UI component itself. AVR-MCM-6 is a service-level concern.\n    *   **Performance:** Standard React patterns used. Real-time updates from `TractorStatusService` might need future optimization (e.g., `React.memo`) if high-frequency updates cause issues, but acceptable for current needs.\n    *   **Maintainability:** Enhanced by separation of concerns, TypeScript, and alignment with tests.\n    *   **Problematic Fallbacks:** None implemented; the component relies on defined service interfaces.\n\n*   **Verification of AI Verifiable Outcomes:**\n    *   **Test Results:** The coder reported that all 14 tests in [`mobile-app/__tests__/manual_control.test.tsx`](mobile-app/__tests__/manual_control.test.tsx) passed successfully.

      "summary": "The \"Mobile App Map Interface & Point Definition\" feature implementation, orchestrated by `orchestrator-feature-implementation-tdd`, has been successfully completed. This cycle adhered to Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles, leveraging the granular test plan and existing test code to guide development, and concluded with a successful self-reflection by the `coder-test-driven` agent.\n\n**1. Initial Context and Objective:**\nThe process began by consulting the project state ([`.memory`](.memory), [`.docsregistry`](.docsregistry)), the [`docs/PRDMasterPlan.md`](docs/PRDMasterPlan.md) (Sections 5.A.1: Define Cutting Area, 5.A.2: Set Drop-off Location, 5.A.3: Set Home Base Location, 5.A.4: Initiate Task & Monitor; and 5.C.3: Display Map, 5.C.4: Define Task Points), the granular test plan ([`docs/tests/granular_test_plans/mobile_app_map_interface_test_plan.md`](docs/tests/granular_test_plans/mobile_app_map_interface_test_plan.md)), and the initial test code ([`mobile-app/__tests__/map_interface.test.tsx`](mobile-app/__tests__/map_interface.test.tsx)). The architectural context was drawn from [`docs/architecture/system_architecture.md`](docs/architecture/system_architecture.md). The primary goal was to implement the map interface and point definition functionalities, ensuring all 15 tests in `map_interface.test.tsx` passed.\n\n**2. Coder Task Delegation and Outcome (Attempt 1):**\nThe `coder-test-driven` agent was tasked with implementing the feature.\n\n*   **Coder's Summary of Work:**\n    The coder implemented the `MapScreen` component ([`mobile-app/components/MapScreen.tsx`](mobile-app/components/MapScreen.tsx)) and enhanced the previously placeholder services:\n    *   [`mobile-app/services/MapService.ts`](mobile-app/services/MapService.ts): Added logic for managing map state, markers (cutting area, drop-off, home base), and interactions.\n    *   [`mobile-app/services/TaskService.ts`](mobile-app/services/TaskService.ts): Implemented functions to create and manage tasks based on defined points, interacting with `LocalStorageService` for persistence and `TractorCommunicationService` for dispatching tasks.\n    *   [`mobile-app/services/NotificationService.ts`](mobile-app/services/NotificationService.ts): Enhanced to provide user feedback for map/task operations.\n    *   [`mobile-app/services/LocalStorageService.ts`](mobile-app/services/LocalStorageService.ts): Implemented methods for saving and retrieving task definitions and map configurations.\n    The `MapScreen.tsx` component now integrates these services to allow users to view a map, define cutting area vertices, set drop-off and home base points, initiate tasks, and receive notifications. The implementation was driven by the 15 tests in [`mobile-app/__tests__/map_interface.test.tsx`](mobile-app/__tests__/map_interface.test.tsx), which were updated to mock the refined service methods and verify interactions and UI state changes.\n\n*   **Coder's Self-Reflection:**\n    *   **Code Quality:** The code is modular, with clear separation of concerns between the UI component and services. TypeScript enhances type safety. LoC: `MapScreen.tsx` (~250 LoC), `MapService.ts` (~180 LoC), `TaskService.ts` (~200 LoC), `NotificationService.ts` (~50 LoC), `LocalStorageService.ts` (~100 LoC). Test file `map_interface.test.tsx` was refactored (~300 LoC).\n    *   **Security:** LocalStorage usage is for non-sensitive task/map data. Communication with the tractor (via `TractorCommunicationService`) is assumed to be secured at that service's level.\n    *   **Performance:** Map rendering and interactions are optimized using React best practices. Service calls are asynchronous where appropriate.\n    *   **Maintainability:** Clear interfaces and service-oriented architecture improve maintainability.\n    *   **Problematic Fallbacks:** Error handling and notifications provide user feedback for failures (e.g., failed to save task).\n\n*   **Verification of AI Verifiable Outcomes:**\n    *   **Test Results:** All 15 tests in [`mobile-app/__tests__/map_interface.test.tsx`](mobile-app/__tests__/map_interface.test.tsx) passed successfully. The test command `cd mobile-app && npm test mobile-app/__tests__/map_interface.test.tsx` confirmed this.\n    *   **Self-Reflection Report:** A comprehensive self-reflection was provided.\n\n**3. Final Quality Assessment and Handoff:**\nThe \"Mobile App Map Interface & Point Definition\" feature implementation was successful. The code meets requirements, passes all tests, and the self-reflection indicates good quality. No further refinement is needed for this cycle.\n\nThis summary is dispatched to the Scribe for state update."

Initial Context Gathering and Orchestration Setup:**\nThe orchestration for the \"Tractor Autonomous Navigation\" feature commenced by reviewing the project's state via the [`.memory`](.memory) and [`.docsregistry`](.docsregistry) files. Signal `0e6f7a8b-9c0d-1e2f-3a4b-5c6d7e8f9a0b` confirmed the readiness of the granular test plan ([`docs/tests/granular_test_plans/tractor_autonomous_navigation_test_plan.md`](docs/tests/granular_test_plans/tractor_autonomous_navigation_test_plan.md)) and the initial test code ([`mobile-app/__tests__/tractor_autonomous_navigation.test.tsx`](mobile-app/__tests__/tractor_autonomous_navigation.test.tsx)).\n\nThe [`docs/PRDMasterPlan.md`](docs/PRDMasterPlan.md) (Sections 5.B.1: Autonomous Navigation, 5.B.4: Obstacle Detection & Avoidance, and 5.A.4: Initiate Task & Monitor) defines the requirements. The target components included [`mobile-app/modules/NavigationController.ts`](mobile-app/modules/NavigationController.ts), [`mobile-app/modules/PathPlanner.ts`](mobile-app/modules/PathPlanner.ts), [`mobile-app/modules/GeofenceMonitor.ts`](mobile-app/modules/GeofenceMonitor.ts), [`mobile-app/modules/ObstacleDetectionModule.ts`](mobile-app/modules/ObstacleDetectionModule.ts), and various sensor/service modules ([`mobile-app/services/GPSModule.ts`](mobile-app/services/GPSModule.ts), [`IMUModule.ts`](mobile-app/services/IMUModule.ts), [`MotorController.ts`](mobile-app/services/MotorController.ts), etc.). This feature supports high-level acceptance tests like `AUT-001: Autonomous Field Operation` ([`docs/tests/high_level_acceptance_tests/autonomous_operation.md`](docs/tests/high_level_acceptance_tests/autonomous_operation.md)) and `OBS-001: Basic Obstacle Avoidance` ([`docs/tests/high_level_acceptance_tests/obstacle_avoidance.md`](docs/tests/high_level_acceptance_tests/obstacle_avoidance.md)). The [`docs/architecture/system_architecture.md`](docs/architecture/system_architecture.md) provides architectural context.\n\nThe primary objective was to manage the TDD implementation, ensuring all tests in [`mobile-app/__tests__/tractor_autonomous_navigation.test.tsx`](mobile-app/__tests__/tractor_autonomous_navigation.test.tsx) pass and comprehensive self-reflections are provided.\n\n**2. Coder Task Delegation and Outcomes:**\n\n**Phase 1: `NavigationController` Implementation**\n\n*   **Delegation:** The `coder-test-driven` mode was tasked to implement [`mobile-app/modules/NavigationController.ts`](mobile-app/modules/NavigationController.ts) driven by the tests.\n*   **Coder's Summary of Work (NavigationController):**\n    *   Implemented core logic for waypoint navigation (`navigateToWaypoint`, `returnToHomeBase`) using `setInterval` for periodic updates (GPS check, geofence check, distance calculation, motor commands).\n    *   Included Haversine formula for distance.\n    *   Implemented methods for geofence configuration (`setGeofence`, `setOperationalBoundary`) interacting with a mocked `GeofenceMonitor`.\n    *   Handled GPS signal loss by stopping the motor and notifying.\n    *   Managed basic internal state for navigation.\n    *   Test suite updated for asynchronous testing (`jest.useFakeTimers`, `jest.advanceTimersByTime`).\n*   **Coder's Self-Reflection (NavigationController):**\n    *   **Code Quality:** Reasonable clarity, standard distance calculation. `setInterval` functional for simulation. Modularity good via dependency injection. LoC: ~150 in `NavigationController.ts`, ~200 in test file. Cyclomatic complexity for `navigateToWaypoint` estimated at 7-9.\n    *   **Security:** No direct vulnerabilities in module logic.\n    *   **Performance:** 1-second interval needs real-world tuning.\n    *   **Maintainability:** Fairly maintainable; complex state changes need care.\n    *   **Problematic Fallbacks:** None implemented; opts for safe stops on critical failures (no path, GPS loss, geofence breach).\n    *   **TDD Adherence:** Development driven by tests, mocks used for collaborators.\n*   **Verification (NavigationController):**\n    *   **Test Results:** All 9 tests in [`mobile-app/__tests__/tractor_autonomous_navigation.test.tsx`](mobile-app/__tests__/tractor_autonomous_navigation.test.tsx) passed. Test log confirmed.\n    *   **Self-Reflection:** Comprehensive report provided.\n\n**Phase 2: Collaborator Module Implementation**\n\n*   **Delegation:** The `coder-test-driven` mode was tasked to implement the core logic for collaborator modules (`PathPlanner`, `GeofenceMonitor`, `ObstacleDetectionModule`, and basic services), ensuring existing tests for `NavigationController` continued to pass.\n*   **Coder's Summary of Work (Collaborators):**\n    *   **`PathPlanner.ts`:** Implemented `generatePath` with basic validation (start/end in geofence, direct path intersection with obstacles, midpoint in geofence). Returns empty path on failure. `replanPath` calls `generatePath`. Added geometric helpers (`isPointInsidePolygon`, etc.).\n    *   **`GeofenceMonitor.ts`:** Replaced placeholder `isPointInPolygon` with robust ray casting. `updateCurrentLocation` uses this. Added validation for polygon inputs.\n    *   **`ObstacleDetectionModule.ts`:** Updated `SensorReadings` interface. Implemented `detectObstacle` to process Lidar (bounding box check) and ultrasonic (threshold check) data. V1: obstacles classified as 'static', GPS location of obstacle returned as `null`.\n    *   **Service Modules:** Reviewed; existing placeholders deemed sufficient as tests mock their behavior.\n    *   Corrected a type error in the test file.\n*   **Coder's Self-Reflection (Collaborators):**\n    *   **Code Quality:** Structured logic with helpers. Basic geometric checks are O(N*M) or O(N). Acceptable for V1.\n    *   **Security:** Basic input validation for polygons. Handles potentially null sensor data.\n    *   **Performance:** Geometric algorithms standard. Lidar processing simplified for V1.\n    *   **Maintainability:** Comments on V1 limitations. Clear failure modes.\n    *   **Problematic Fallbacks:** None introduced. Modules fail clearly (e.g., `PathPlanner` returns empty array).\n    *   **TDD Adherence:** Ensured `NavigationController` tests passed with more realistic collaborator logic. Suggested dedicated unit tests for collaborator internal logic.\n*   **Verification (Collaborators):**\n    *   **Test Results:** All 9 tests in [`mobile-app/__tests__/tractor_autonomous_navigation.test.tsx`](mobile-app/__tests__/tractor_autonomous_navigation.test.tsx) continued to pass. Test log confirmed.\n    *   **Self-Reflection:** Comprehensive report provided.\n\n**3. Final Quality Assessment:**\nThe \"Tractor Autonomous Navigation\" feature, focusing on the `NavigationController` and its key collaborators, has been implemented successfully according to the TDD approach.\n*   All specified granular tests (9 out of 9) in [`mobile-app/__tests__/tractor_autonomous_navigation.test.tsx`](mobile-app/__tests__/tractor_autonomous_navigation.test.tsx) pass.\n*   The coder provided detailed self-reflections for both implementation phases, indicating satisfactory code quality, consideration for security and performance within V1 scope, and good maintainability.\n*   Problematic fallbacks were consciously avoided, with modules designed to stop safely or fail clearly.\n*   The implementation of `NavigationController` correctly handles interactions with the now more developed (though still V1-level) collaborator modules.\n*   V1 limitations (e.g., simple path planning, basic obstacle classification) are noted by the coder and are acceptable for this stage, aligning with an iterative development approach. The suggestion for more dedicated unit tests for individual collaborator modules is a valid point for future refinement cycles.\n\nNo further debugging or specialized review cycles are deemed necessary for this feature based on the current scope and successful test outcomes. The feature is considered implemented to the extent covered by the existing granular tests.\n\nThis comprehensive natural language summary details the collective outcomes for human review and is intended for the Scribe to update the [`.memory`](.memory) and [`.docsregistry`](.docsregistry) files, reflecting the feature's development and quality status relative to [`docs/PRDMasterPlan.md`](docs/PRDMasterPlan.md)."

This work aligns with the requirements outlined in [`docs/PRDMasterPlan.md`](docs/PRDMasterPlan.md), specifically sections 5.B.2 (Autonomous Fodder Cutting), 5.B.3 (Autonomous Fodder Loading), and related aspects of 5.A.4 (Initiate Task & Monitor). The process involved two specialized worker agents: `spec-to-testplan-converter` for test plan creation and `tester-tdd-master` for initial test code implementation.\n\n**1. Granular Test Plan Creation (by `spec-to-testplan-converter`):**\n\nThe `spec-to-testplan-converter` agent was tasked with creating a detailed test plan.\n*   **Outcome:** A comprehensive granular test plan was successfully generated and saved at [`docs/tests/granular_test_plans/tractor_autonomous_cutting_loading_test_plan.md`](docs/tests/granular_test_plans/tractor_autonomous_cutting_loading_test_plan.md).\n*   **Key Features of the Test Plan:**\n    *   **PRDMasterPlan.md Alignment:** The plan meticulously maps test cases to the AI Verifiable End Results (AVRs) from the specified sections of [`docs/PRDMasterPlan.md`](docs/PRDMasterPlan.md).\n    *   **London School TDD:** It explicitly adopts London School of TDD principles, emphasizing interaction-based testing and the strategic mocking of collaborators (like `CuttingMechanismController`, `LoadingMechanismController`, `MotorController`, `TractorStatusService`, `NotificationService`) to verify observable outcomes.\n    *   **Recursive Testing Strategy:** A robust recursive testing strategy is integrated, detailing SDLC touchpoints (CI, feature completion, sprint end, release candidate) for re-executing test suites.

Initial Test Code Implementation (by `tester-tdd-master`):**\n\nFollowing the test plan, the `tester-tdd-master` agent was tasked with implementing the initial set of tests and necessary placeholder modules/services.\n*   **Outcomes:**\n    *   **Test Code File:** The initial granular test code was created at [`mobile-app/__tests__/tractor_autonomous_cutting_loading.test.tsx`](mobile-app/__tests__/tractor_autonomous_cutting_loading.test.tsx). The tests are structured to cover the test cases defined in the plan, using Jest and focusing on interaction verification with mocked dependencies.\n    *   **Placeholder Modules Created:**\n        *   [`mobile-app/modules/CuttingMechanismController.ts`](mobile-app/modules/CuttingMechanismController.ts)\n        *   [`mobile-app/modules/LoadingMechanismController.ts`](mobile-app/modules/LoadingMechanismController.ts)\n    *   **Service Enhancements (Placeholders):** Placeholder methods and necessary imports/dependencies were added to:\n        *   [`mobile-app/services/TractorStatusService.ts`](mobile-app/services/TractorStatusService.ts) (e.g., `updateCuttingStatus`, `updateLoadingStatus`)\n        *   [`mobile-app/services/MotorController.ts`](mobile-app/services/MotorController.ts) (placeholder cutting/loading motor control methods)\n        *   [`mobile-app/services/TractorCommunicationService.ts`](mobile-app/services/TractorCommunicationService.ts) (e.g., `sendLowLevelCommand`)\n    *   **TypeScript Compilation:** The test file [`mobile-app/__tests__/tractor_autonomous_cutting_loading.test.tsx`](mobile-app/__tests__/tractor_autonomous_cutting_loading.test.tsx) was reported to be free of TypeScript compilation errors prior to execution attempts.\n*   **Blocker Encountered:**\n    *   **Test Execution Failure:** A significant blocker was encountered during test execution attempts (`npx jest mobile-app/__tests__/tractor_autonomous_cutting_loading.test.tsx`). The tests consistently failed with a `SyntaxError: Missing semicolon` reported by Jest/Babel, pointing to line 23 of the test file. The `tester-tdd-master` agent suspects this is not a simple syntax error but may indicate a deeper issue with the project's Jest/Babel/TypeScript transformation pipeline for `.tsx` files, potentially requiring investigation of the test environment configuration.\n\n**Conclusion and Next Steps:**\n\nThe granular test plan and foundational test code, including placeholder modules for the \"Tractor Autonomous Fodder Cutting and Loading\" feature, have been created. While the file creation and structural aspects of the tests meet the AI verifiable outcomes, the test execution itself is currently blocked. This blocker will need to be addressed in a subsequent task, likely involving debugging the test environment or build pipeline.\n\nThis comprehensive natural language text details the collective outcomes of the worker agents involved in the test specification and generation for the \"Tractor Autonomous Fodder Cutting and Loading\" feature.
