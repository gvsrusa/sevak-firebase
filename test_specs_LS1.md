# Test Specifications for LS1 Update of Zero-Code User Blueprint

**Document Under Test:** [`docs/Zero-Code User Blueprint for SPARC Program Generator.md`](docs/Zero-Code%20User%20Blueprint%20for%20SPARC%20Program%20Generator.md)
**Source of Changes:** `prompts_LS1.md` (resulting in `responses_LS1.md` artifact, which is the updated blueprint)

## 1. Placeholder Completion

**Objective:** Verify that all placeholders identified in the original document and targeted for update via `prompts_LS1.md` have been appropriately filled with specific information.

**Test Cases:**

*   **TS1.1: Verify User Name Placeholder:**
    *   **Action:** Check the document (e.g., around original line 12 or equivalent) for the placeholder "(User's Name - as per blueprint)".
    *   **Expected Result:** The placeholder is replaced with a specific user name or relevant information as defined by the blueprint/prompts. It should not be the literal placeholder text.
*   **TS1.2: Verify All Other Identified Placeholders:**
    *   **Action:** Review `prompts_LS1.md` to identify all placeholders that were instructed to be filled. For each, locate the corresponding section in the updated document.
    *   **Expected Result:** Each identified placeholder is replaced with concrete information and does not remain in its placeholder form (e.g., `[Specify X]`, `(Details TBD)`, `(User's Role)`).

## 2. Resolution of Open Issues

**Objective:** Ensure that Section 10 ('Open Issues & Questions to Resolve') reflects progress, with items now containing answers, proposed solutions, or clear next steps.

**Test Cases:**

*   **TS2.1: Review Each Item in Section 10:**
    *   **Action:** For every issue/question originally listed in Section 10 (as per the pre-update version or inferred from `prompts_LS1.md`), examine its current status in the updated document.
    *   **Expected Result:** Each item should clearly indicate:
        *   A specific answer or resolution.
        *   A proposed solution with a plan for validation.
        *   A defined next step for investigation, including responsible parties or timelines if applicable.
        *   Items should not remain as open-ended questions without any new information or plan.
*   **TS2.2: Verify No New Unaddressed Open Issues Introduced (in this section):**
    *   **Action:** Scan Section 10 for any new issues that might have been added.
    *   **Expected Result:** If new issues are present, they should also have a proposed solution or next step, unless explicitly marked as newly identified and pending discussion.

## 3. Expansion of Sections

**Objective:** Confirm that sections specifically marked for expansion (e.g., detailed features around original line 237) have been comprehensively detailed as per `prompts_LS1.md`.

**Test Cases:**

*   **TS3.1: Verify Expansion of "Detailed Features" Section:**
    *   **Action:** Locate the section related to "Detailed Features" (e.g., originally noted for expansion around line 237). Compare its current detail level with the instructions in `prompts_LS1.md`.
    *   **Expected Result:** The section is significantly more detailed, providing comprehensive descriptions, sub-features, or examples as requested by the prompts. It should not be a brief overview if expansion was required.
*   **TS3.2: Verify All Other Identified Sections for Expansion:**
    *   **Action:** Review `prompts_LS1.md` to identify all other sections that were instructed to be expanded. For each, locate the corresponding section in the updated document.
    *   **Expected Result:** Each identified section shows a clear increase in detail and comprehensiveness, aligning with the expansion requirements from the prompts.

## 4. Overall Document Quality

**Objective:** Assess the overall quality of the document in terms of coherence, consistency, completeness, clarity, and adherence to scope.

**Test Cases:**

### 4.1 Coherence

*   **TS4.1.1: Logical Flow:**
    *   **Action:** Read through the document from beginning to end.
    *   **Expected Result:** The document presents a logical progression of information. Sections connect smoothly, and the overall narrative about the "Sevak" project is easy to follow.
*   **TS4.1.2: Unified Understanding:**
    *   **Action:** Evaluate if all sections contribute to a single, clear vision of the "Sevak" project.
    *   **Expected Result:** All parts of the document align and support the main goals and objectives of the project without contradictions.

### 4.2 Consistency

*   **TS4.2.1: Terminology:**
    *   **Action:** Scan the document for key terms (e.g., "Sevak," "Mobile App," "Cutting Area," "SPARC Program Generator," "User Persona names").
    *   **Expected Result:** Terms are used consistently throughout. Variations are minimal and justified if present. Capitalization of specific terms is consistent.
*   **TS4.2.2: Formatting:**
    *   **Action:** Check headings (levels, style), lists (bullet points, numbering), and emphasis (bold, italics).
    *   **Expected Result:** Formatting is uniform across the document, adhering to a consistent style guide (even if implicit). For example, all H2 headings should look the same.

### 4.3 Completeness

*   **TS4.3.1: PRD Structure Adherence:**
    *   **Action:** Compare the document's sections against a standard or expected PRD structure (e.g., Introduction, Goals, User Personas, User Stories, Features, Non-Functional Requirements, Data Model, Integration Points, Release Milestones, Future Considerations, Open Issues).
    *   **Expected Result:** All critical sections for a PRD of this nature are present and appear to be adequately addressed.
*   **TS4.3.2: User Story Coverage:**
    *   **Action:** Review the User Stories section.
    *   **Expected Result:** User stories cover the key functionalities and user interactions expected for V1. They should be well-formed (e.g., "As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit/value]").
*   **TS4.3.3: Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs):**
    *   **Action:** Examine the NFRs section.
    *   **Expected Result:** NFRs (e.g., performance, security, usability, scalability) are defined and are specific enough to be testable or verifiable.
*   **TS4.3.4: Data Model Clarity:**
    *   **Action:** Review the Data Model section.
    *   **Expected Result:** The data model is presented clearly, outlining key entities, attributes, and relationships relevant to the project.
*   **TS4.3.5: Integration Points:**
    *   **Action:** Check the section on Integration Points.
    *   **Expected Result:** Key external or internal systems with which "Sevak" will interact are identified, and the nature of the integration is described.
*   **TS4.3.6: Release Milestones:**
    *   **Action:** Review the Release Milestones.
    *   **Expected Result:** Milestones are logical, outlining a phased approach to V1 delivery if applicable, or clear deliverables for the initial release.

### 4.4 Clarity

*   **TS4.4.1: Language Use:**
    *   **Action:** Read through various sections, paying attention to language.
    *   **Expected Result:** The language is clear, concise, and unambiguous. It avoids jargon where possible or explains it if necessary. The document is easily understandable by the target audience (SPARC program generation team).
*   **TS4.4.2: Acronyms and Abbreviations:**
    *   **Action:** Check for acronyms and abbreviations.
    *   **Expected Result:** All acronyms and abbreviations are defined upon first use or in a dedicated glossary section.

### 4.5 Adherence to Scope

*   **TS4.5.1: "In Scope (V1)" Alignment:**
    *   **Action:** Compare the features, user stories, and functionalities described throughout the document with the "In Scope (V1)" list (typically found in Section 3 or equivalent).
    *   **Expected Result:** All described elements align with what is defined as "In Scope (V1)".
*   **TS4.5.2: "Out of Scope (V1)" Avoidance:**
    *   **Action:** Check if any described features or functionalities fall under the "Out of Scope (V1)" list.
    *   **Expected Result:** "Out of Scope (V1)" items are not included in the detailed descriptions for V1, unless there's an explicit justification for a scope change, which should be clearly noted and approved (e.g., in a change log or amendment section).

## Test Execution Notes:

*   Access to the `prompts_LS1.md` file is crucial for verifying specific changes related to placeholders and section expansions.
*   Access to the *previous version* of the blueprint document would be beneficial for a more precise comparison, especially for placeholder and expansion verification.
*   These tests are primarily designed for manual or semi-automated review.
