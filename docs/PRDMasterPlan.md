# 5. Detailed Features & Functionalities

(This section will detail key features of both the Tractor and the Mobile App. For brevity in this initial PRD generation, I'll focus on the core "Autonomous Fodder Cutting & Transport Initiation via App" and then list others with slightly less detail than the "PromptCraft Pro" example, but the SPARC team would expand these fully.)

## Feature 5.A: Autonomous Fodder Cutting & Transport Task Management (Mobile App & Tractor)

**User Problem Solved:** Automates the entire process of defining a work area, initiating fodder cutting, and having it transported, freeing the farmer from manual labor and constant supervision. 

**How it Supports Goals:** Directly addresses core goals of reducing labor, increasing efficiency, and ensuring ease of use. 

### 5.A.1: Define Cutting Area (Mobile App) 

* **Detailed Description:** Users can view an interactive map (e.g., satellite or simple schematic view) of their surroundings. They can use a "draw polygon" tool to tap points on the map, creating a closed boundary that defines the specific area in their field where fodder needs to be cut. 
* **Step-by-Step User Interaction Flow:** 
    1.  User opens Sevak app, navigates to "Map & Task Management" or "Create New Task" screen. 
    2.  App displays a map centered on the user's (or tractor's last known) location. 
    3.  User selects "Define Cutting Area" or a polygon drawing tool icon. 
    4.  User taps sequentially on the map to define vertices of the cutting area. The app visually connects these points to form a polygon. 
    5.  User can adjust points or clear the polygon and restart. 
    6.  User confirms/saves the polygon. It may be assigned a default name or user can name it (e.g., "North Field Patch"). 
* **UI/UX Considerations:** 
    * Clear iconography for drawing tools. 
    * Map should be responsive and allow zoom/pan. 
    * Visual feedback as polygon is drawn. 
    * Easy editing/undo for points. 
    * Option to save frequently used areas. 
    * High contrast for outdoor visibility. 
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * User can successfully draw and save a valid polygonal cutting area on the map. 
    * The defined area's coordinates are stored correctly. 
    * The app prevents creation of invalid polygons (e.g., self-intersecting, if problematic for path planning). 

### 5.A.2: Set Drop-off Location (Mobile App) 

* **Detailed Description:** Users can place a pin on the map to designate where the Sevak tractor should deliver the cut fodder. 
* **Step-by-Step User Interaction Flow:** 
    1.  Within the task creation flow (after or before defining cutting area). 
    2.  User selects "Set Drop-off Location" or a pin-drop tool icon. 
    3.  User taps on the map to place the pin. The pin can be dragged to adjust its position. 
    4.  User confirms/saves the drop-off location. It may be named (e.g., "Cow Shed Door"). 
* **UI/UX Considerations:**
    * Clear pin icon. 
    * Easy to tap and drag. 
    * Option to save frequently used drop-off points. 
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * User can successfully set and save a drop-off location pin on the map. 
    * The location's coordinates are stored correctly. 

### 5.A.3: Set Home Base Location (Mobile App - Optional for task, but needed for "Return Home")

* **Detailed Description:** Similar to setting a drop-off location, users can define a "Home Base" or charging station location. 
* **User Interaction:** Similar to 5.A.2. 
* **Acceptance Criteria:** User can set and save a home base location. 

### 5.A.4: Initiate Task & Monitor (Mobile App & Tractor) 

* **Detailed Description:** Once cutting area and drop-off are defined, the user can start the task. The app sends the task parameters (area coordinates, drop-off coordinates) to the Sevak tractor. The tractor then autonomously executes the task: navigates to the field, cuts fodder, loads it, transports it to the drop-off, and notifies the user. The app provides real-time status updates. 
* **Step-by-Step User Interaction Flow (Key Feature Deep Dive from Blueprint):**
    1.  Farmer opens the Sevak mobile app. Sees Dashboard with Sevak's current status (e.g., "Idle at Home Base," Battery: 80%). 
    2.  Farmer navigates to "Map & Task Management" or selects a saved task. 
    3.  (Assuming area and drop-off are defined as per 5.A.1, 5.A.2). Farmer reviews the task details on the map. 
    4.  Farmer clicks a prominent "Start Task" (or "Start Cutting & Transport") button. 
    5.  App confirms command transmission to Sevak. Status changes (e.g., "Command Sent"). 
    6.  Sevak tractor acknowledges command. App status updates to "Navigating to Field." Tractor's physical movement begins. App shows Sevak's icon moving on the map. 
    7.  Upon reaching the cutting area, Sevak begins cutting fodder (e.g., in systematic rows). App status changes to "Cutting Fodder." App may show estimated % area cut or time remaining. 
    8.  Loading mechanism operates simultaneously or in phases. 
    9.  Once cutting is complete (or trailer is full, if sensed/estimated), Sevak stops cutting. App status changes to "Transporting Fodder." 
    10. Sevak autonomously navigates to the predefined drop-off location. 
    11. Upon arrival, Sevak stops. App status changes to "Awaiting Unloading at [Drop-off Name]." A notification is sent to the farmer's phone. 
    12. Farmer manually unloads fodder. 
    13. Farmer can then instruct Sevak via app to "Return Home" or start another predefined task. 
* **UI/UX Considerations (App):**
    * Large, unambiguous "Start," "Pause," "Stop Task" buttons. 
    * Clear visual indication of tractor's current action and location on map. 
    * Progress indicators (e.g., percentage complete, estimated time). 
    * Persistent notifications for critical events (task complete, error, low battery). 
* **Tractor Behavior:**
    * Path planning algorithm for navigation and cutting pattern. 
    * Smooth acceleration/deceleration. 
    * Cutter and loader engage/disengage automatically as per task logic. 
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * User can successfully initiate a defined task from the app. 
    * Tractor receives task parameters and begins autonomous operation. 
    * Tractor navigates to the cutting area within an acceptable margin of error. 
    * Tractor cuts fodder within the defined polygon (e.g., >90% coverage). 
    * Tractor transports fodder to the drop-off location within an acceptable margin of error. 
    * App accurately reflects tractor status and location throughout the task. 
    * User receives notification upon task completion or critical events.

**Data Relationships:**

* A UserDevice is paired with one Tractor. 
* A Tractor can execute one Task at a time. 
* A Task defines one `cuttingArea` (polygon), one `dropOffLocation`, and optionally one `homeBaseLocation`. 
* TaskExecutionLog entries are associated with a specific Task. 
* ErrorLogEntry entries are associated with a Tractor and potentially a Task if an error occurs during execution. 

# 8. Integration Points

* **8.1. Sevak Tractor Internal Systems:** 
    * Control Unit to Sensors: Interfaces for GPS, IMU, LiDAR, Ultrasonic sensors, Cameras. (Specific protocols TBD based on sensor selection: Serial, I2C, SPI, USB, Ethernet). 
    * Control Unit to Actuators: Interfaces for motor controllers (drive, steering, cutter, loader). (PWM, CAN bus, or other motor control protocols). 
    * Control Unit to Power System: Interface with BMS for battery level and status. 
* **8.2. Sevak Tractor to Mobile App:** 
    * Communication Protocol: Secure Wi-Fi (e.g., TCP/IP or UDP based custom protocol, or MQTT over local Wi-Fi) or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) / Bluetooth Classic. 
    * Data Exchange: 
        * App to Tractor: Task definitions (coordinates, action sequence), commands (start, stop, manual controls), settings updates. 
        * Tractor to App: Real-time status (location, battery, current action), sensor data summaries (for obstacle alerts), error codes, task progress, log data. 
* **8.3. Mobile App to Mapping Services (Optional, for map display):** 
    * If using a third-party mapping SDK (e.g., Google Maps SDK, Mapbox SDK, OpenStreetMap SDK) for displaying satellite/street maps: API integration as per SDK requirements. 
    * Alternatively, a very simple custom grid-based map could be used if external map services are too complex or costly for V1. 
* **8.4. Sevak Tractor Components (Sourcing):** 
    * Emphasis on locally sourceable or readily available components for motors, batteries, basic sensors, and mechanical parts to ensure affordability and maintainability. 

# 9. Release Plan / Milestones (Conceptual for V1)

**Phase 1: Core Tractor Mobility & Manual Control (Target: M1-M3)** 

* **Tractor:** Basic chassis, drivetrain, power system operational. Onboard control unit boots and can control motors. Physical E-Stop functional. 
* **App:** Basic app structure. Pairing with tractor via Wi-Fi/Bluetooth. Manual control (virtual joystick) for tractor movement. Manual engagement of cutter/loader (if mechanisms are ready). Display basic status (battery, connectivity). 
* **Goal:** Demonstrate reliable remote manual operation of the tractor platform. 

**Phase 2: Basic Autonomous Navigation & Task Definition (Target: M4-M6)** 

* **Tractor:** GPS & IMU integration. Ability to autonomously navigate to a single GPS waypoint and stop. Basic geofencing (stop if boundary crossed). Obstacle detection (stop on detection). 
* **App:** Map interface for defining a single point (e.g., "Go To Point"). Send point to tractor. Start/stop "Go To Point" task. Display tractor location on map. 
* **Goal:** Demonstrate basic point-to-point autonomous navigation and simple tasking.

# 10. Open Issues & Questions to Resolve

* **Sensor Suite Optimization:** Final selection of LiDAR, cameras, ultrasonic sensors based on cost, performance in dusty/outdoor conditions, and processing power requirements. What is the minimum viable sensor set for safe and effective navigation and obstacle avoidance? 
* **Path Planning Algorithm:** Specific algorithm for field coverage (cutting pattern) and navigation between points. Consider computational load on onboard processor. 
* **Cutting/Loading Mechanism Design:** Detailed mechanical design for robustness, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Power requirements. 
* **Battery Sizing & Charging Strategy:** Required battery capacity for a typical operational cycle (e.g., X hours or Y area). Charging time. Feasibility of autonomous docking for charging vs. manual plug-in. 
* **Local Communication Reliability:** Range and stability of Wi-Fi/Bluetooth in typical farm environments. Fallback strategies if connection is intermittent. 
* **Mapping Solution for App:** Use of third-party SDK vs. custom simple map. Cost, offline capabilities, and ease of use implications. 
* **Cost of Bill of Materials (BOM):** Ongoing tracking to ensure affordability goals are met. 
* **Specific ROS Packages/Modules:** If ROS is used, which existing packages can be leveraged for navigation, perception, communication? 
* **Language Support:** Prioritization of local languages beyond English for the app interface. 
* **Maintenance & Repair Strategy:** Plan for user-level maintenance and local technician repair capabilities. 
* **Trailer Fill Detection:** V1 assumes cutting a defined area or user judgment. If basic fill estimation is needed, how (e.g., timer, area-based estimate, simple sensor)? 
* **Legal & Regulatory Compliance:** Are there any local regulations in India regarding autonomous agricultural vehicles, even small ones? (Likely minimal for this scale, but worth a check). 
* **User Training Materials:** What simple guides (pictorial, video) will be needed for farmers? 

This PRD will be a living document and will be updated as the project progresses and more information becomes available.
