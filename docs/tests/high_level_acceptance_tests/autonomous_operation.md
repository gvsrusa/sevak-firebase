# High-Level Acceptance Tests: Autonomous Operation

This document outlines high-level acceptance tests for the autonomous operation capabilities of Project Sevak, as defined in the [`docs/research/high_level_test_strategy_report.md`](../../research/high_level_test_strategy_report.md:67) and referenced in the [`docs/tests/master_acceptance_test_plan.md`](../master_acceptance_test_plan.md:115).

## Test Suite: AO - Autonomous Operation

### Test Case: AO-001
*   **ID**: AO-001
*   **Description**: Verify successful completion of a full fodder cutting and transport task cycle in a simple, obstacle-free simulated environment.
*   **Pre-conditions**:
    *   Sevak is in a simulated environment (`simulation_farm_simple_v1`).
    *   Sevak is at the designated 'Home Base' location.
    *   Battery is fully charged (100%).
    *   A rectangular cutting area (`field_A_10x20m`) is defined.
    *   A drop-off point (`dp_shed_east`) is defined.
    *   No obstacles are present in the path or cutting area.
*   **Steps**:
    1.  **Given** the Sevak system is initialized in the 'simulation_farm_simple_v1' environment at 'Home Base' with a full battery.
    2.  **And** a task is defined with cutting area 'field_A_10x20m', drop-off 'dp_shed_east', and return to 'Home Base'.
    3.  **When** the autonomous task is initiated via the Task Management UI.
    4.  **Then** Sevak should autonomously navigate from 'Home Base' to 'field_A_10x20m'.
    5.  **And** Sevak should cut fodder within the boundaries of 'field_A_10x20m' following an efficient path.
    6.  **And** Sevak should transport the cut fodder to 'dp_shed_east'.
    7.  **And** Sevak should return to 'Home Base'.
    8.  **And** the system status should indicate 'Task Completed'.
*   **Expected Results**:
    *   Sevak successfully navigates to the cutting area, performs cutting, navigates to the drop-off point, and returns to home base.
    *   The entire operation is completed autonomously without manual intervention.
    *   Path followed is within +/- 0.5m of the planned path in simulation.
    *   Cutting coverage is >98% of the defined area.
    *   Task completion is logged with correct timestamps and details.
*   **AI Verifiable Pass/Fail Criteria**:
    *   **Pass**:
        *   Simulation log file `sevak_sim_log_[timestamp].txt` contains "EVENT:NAV_TO_FIELD_START", "EVENT:CUTTING_START", "EVENT:CUTTING_COMPLETE", "EVENT:NAV_TO_DROPOFF_START", "EVENT:FODDER_DELIVERED", "EVENT:NAV_TO_HOME_START", "EVENT:TASK_COMPLETED_SUCCESS".
        *   GPS track data in log shows path deviation from planned route is less than 0.5m for 95% of waypoints.
        *   Simulated cutting area coverage map (generated from logs) shows >98% coverage.
        *   Final system status API `GET /api/sevak/status` returns `{"task_status": "completed", "location": "Home Base"}`.
    *   **Fail**: Any of the above pass conditions are not met, or error codes (e.g., `ERR_NAV_FAILED`, `ERR_CUTTING_BOUNDARY_VIOLATION`) are present in the log.

### Test Case: AO-002
*   **ID**: AO-002
*   **Description**: Verify navigation accuracy and boundary adherence on uneven terrain (simulated).
*   **Pre-conditions**:
    *   Sevak is in a simulated environment (`simulation_farm_uneven_v1`) featuring slopes up to 10 degrees and uneven ground.
    *   Sevak is at 'Home Base', battery at 100%.
    *   A non-rectangular cutting area (`field_B_complex_shape`) is defined on the uneven terrain.
    *   Drop-off and home base are defined.
*   **Steps**:
    1.  **Given** Sevak is in 'simulation_farm_uneven_v1' at 'Home Base' with full battery.
    2.  **And** a task is defined for 'field_B_complex_shape'.
    3.  **When** the autonomous task is initiated.
    4.  **Then** Sevak should navigate and cut within 'field_B_complex_shape', adhering to boundaries despite terrain variations.
    5.  **And** Sevak should complete the full task cycle (cut, transport, return home).
*   **Expected Results**:
    *   Sevak maintains path accuracy (+/- 0.75m in simulation on uneven terrain) and stays within defined boundaries.
    *   No tipping or getting stuck due to terrain.
    *   Task completion is logged.
*   **AI Verifiable Pass/Fail Criteria**:
    *   **Pass**:
        *   Simulation log `sevak_sim_log_[timestamp].txt` confirms task completion without `ERR_BOUNDARY_VIOLATION` or `ERR_STUCK_TERRAIN` or `ERR_TIP_OVER`.
        *   GPS track data shows path deviation < 0.75m for 90% of waypoints.
        *   Log contains "METRIC:MAX_SLOPE_ENCOUNTERED: [value <= 10 degrees]".
        *   Simulated cutting area coverage map shows >95% coverage of the complex shape.
    *   **Fail**: Any pass conditions not met, or relevant error codes logged.

### Test Case: AO-003
*   **ID**: AO-003
*   **Description**: Verify graceful handling of temporary GPS signal loss and recovery during autonomous operation (simulated).
*   **Pre-conditions**:
    *   Sevak is in a simulated environment (`simulation_farm_gps_blackout_zone_v1`) with a defined area of intermittent GPS signal.
    *   Sevak is performing an autonomous cutting task.
*   **Steps**:
    1.  **Given** Sevak is autonomously executing a task in 'simulation_farm_gps_blackout_zone_v1'.
    2.  **When** Sevak enters a simulated GPS blackout zone for 60 seconds.
    3.  **Then** Sevak should detect GPS signal loss and transition to a safe mode (e.g., pause operation or rely on IMU/visual odometry for short-term navigation if implemented).
    4.  **And** an alert "WARN_GPS_SIGNAL_LOST" should be logged and displayed on the UI.
    5.  **When** Sevak exits the GPS blackout zone and signal is restored.
    6.  **Then** Sevak should re-acquire GPS lock and resume the autonomous task from its paused state or re-plan its path.
    7.  **And** an alert "INFO_GPS_SIGNAL_RESTORED" should be logged.
*   **Expected Results**:
    *   Sevak pauses or maintains course safely during GPS loss.
    *   Sevak successfully resumes and completes the task after GPS is restored.
    *   No hazardous behavior during signal loss/recovery.
*   **AI Verifiable Pass/Fail Criteria**:
    *   **Pass**:
        *   Simulation log `sevak_sim_log_[timestamp].txt` contains "EVENT:GPS_SIGNAL_LOST", "STATE:SAFE_PAUSE_GPS_LOSS" (or similar state indicating safe handling), "EVENT:GPS_SIGNAL_RESTORED", "EVENT:TASK_RESUMED".
        *   No `ERR_COLLISION` or `ERR_BOUNDARY_VIOLATION` during or immediately after GPS loss period.
        *   UI log (if available from simulation) shows corresponding alerts.
        *   Task completion status is "SUCCESS".
    *   **Fail**: Collision, boundary violation, failure to resume task, or absence of correct log entries/state transitions.

### Test Case: AO-004
*   **ID**: AO-004
*   **Description**: Verify dynamic path re-planning when a non-hazardous, temporary blockage is encountered (Controlled Environment Test - CET).
*   **Pre-conditions**:
    *   Sevak is in a CET environment.
    *   Sevak is performing an autonomous cutting task along a predefined path.
    *   A temporary, non-hazardous obstacle (e.g., a large bale of hay) is placed on its planned path after the task starts.
*   **Steps**:
    1.  **Given** Sevak is autonomously operating in CET.
    2.  **When** Sevak's sensors detect the unexpected stationary obstacle blocking its planned path.
    3.  **Then** Sevak should safely stop or slow down before reaching the obstacle.
    4.  **And** Sevak should attempt to re-plan a path around the obstacle to continue the task.
    5.  **And** an alert "INFO_PATH_REPLAN_OBSTACLE" should be logged.
    6.  **And** Sevak should successfully navigate around the obstacle and resume its original task.
*   **Expected Results**:
    *   Sevak detects the blockage, re-plans, and navigates around it.
    *   Task is completed successfully.
    *   Minimum safe distance is maintained from the obstacle during re-planning and maneuvering.
*   **AI Verifiable Pass/Fail Criteria**:
    *   **Pass**:
        *   Telemetry log `sevak_cet_log_[timestamp].txt` contains "EVENT:OBSTACLE_DETECTED_STATIC_NONHAZ", "EVENT:PATH_REPLAN_INITIATED", "EVENT:PATH_REPLAN_SUCCESSFUL", "EVENT:TASK_RESUMED_POST_REPLAN".
        *   Sensor data (e.g., LiDAR point cloud, camera images if analyzed by AI) confirms detection of the obstacle.
        *   GPS track shows deviation around the obstacle's known location and then resumption of the original task path.
        *   No collision with the obstacle (verified by proximity sensor data in logs: `min_dist_to_obstacle > safe_threshold`).
    *   **Fail**: Collision with obstacle, failure to re-plan, task abandonment without valid reason, or absence of correct log entries.

*More test cases for different terrains, complex task definitions, and specific navigation algorithm verifications (e.g., efficiency of path coverage) would be added here, following the same structure and drawing from the High-Level Test Strategy Report.*
