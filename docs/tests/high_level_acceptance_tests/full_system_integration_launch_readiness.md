# High-Level Acceptance Tests: Full System Integration & Launch Readiness

This document outlines high-level acceptance tests for full system integration and overall launch readiness of Project Sevak, as defined in the [`docs/research/high_level_test_strategy_report.md`](../../research/high_level_test_strategy_report.md:139) and referenced in the [`docs/tests/master_acceptance_test_plan.md`](../master_acceptance_test_plan.md:130). These tests represent comprehensive end-to-end scenarios.

## Test Suite: FSILR - Full System Integration & Launch Readiness

### Test Case: FSILR-001
*   **ID**: FSILR-001
*   **Description**: "Day in the Life" - Verify Sevak can perform multiple, varied autonomous tasks consecutively over an extended period (e.g., 6-hour simulated workday) in RFT, including handling common operational occurrences.
*   **Pre-conditions**:
    *   Sevak is in a Real-World Field Test (RFT) environment on a partner farm.
    *   Battery fully charged.
    *   A sequence of 3-4 typical tasks is defined (e.g., Task 1: Cut Field A, drop at Silo 1; Task 2: Cut Field B, drop at Silo 2; Task 3: Transport pre-cut fodder from Point X to Point Y).
    *   The RFT environment includes some expected minor obstacles (e.g., small branches, uneven patches - non-critical) and potential for brief GPS signal variations.
*   **Steps**:
    1.  **Given** Sevak is at Home Base in RFT, fully charged, with a 6-hour multi-task sequence defined.
    2.  **When** the multi-task operation is initiated.
    3.  **Then** Sevak should autonomously execute Task 1 (navigate, cut, transport, return/proceed).
    4.  **And** upon completion of Task 1, Sevak should autonomously proceed to and execute Task 2.
    5.  **And** upon completion of Task 2, Sevak should autonomously proceed to and execute Task 3.
    6.  **And** throughout the 6-hour period, Sevak should manage its battery effectively, potentially returning to charge autonomously if required by the task sequence and battery levels (and if this feature is mature).
    7.  **And** Sevak should handle minor, common obstacles and GPS variations without requiring manual intervention for critical failure.
    8.  **And** all operations, including transitions between tasks, should be logged correctly.
*   **Expected Results**:
    *   Sevak successfully completes the entire sequence of tasks over ~6 hours.
    *   Minimal to no manual intervention required for operational issues (critical safety interventions are a fail).
    *   All sub-systems (navigation, cutting, transport, obstacle avoidance, UI alerts, logging, powertrain) function cohesively.
    *   System maintains stability and performance throughout the extended operation.
*   **AI Verifiable Pass/Fail Criteria**:
    *   **Pass**:
        *   Aggregated operational logs (`sevak_rft_daily_log_[date].json`) show:
            *   `EVENT:MULTI_TASK_SEQUENCE_STARTED`, `EVENT:TASK_ID_[1]_COMPLETED`, `EVENT:TASK_ID_[2]_COMPLETED`, `EVENT:TASK_ID_[3]_COMPLETED`, `EVENT:MULTI_TASK_SEQUENCE_COMPLETED`.
            *   Total operational time logged is >= 5.5 hours (allowing for some minor, recoverable delays).
            *   No `ERR_CRITICAL_SYSTEM_FAILURE` or `STATE:MANUAL_INTERVENTION_REQUIRED_OPERATIONAL` entries (safety interventions are separate).
            *   If autonomous charging is part of the test: `EVENT:AUTONOMOUS_CHARGING_CYCLE_COMPLETED` logged appropriately.
        *   Key performance indicators from logs meet targets: e.g., overall area cut, total fodder transported match task definitions within 10% tolerance.
        *   System status API `GET /api/sevak/system_summary` at end of test shows `{"overall_status": "nominal", "tasks_completed_today": 3}`.
    *   **Fail**: Sequence not completed, critical failures requiring non-safety manual intervention, significant deviation from task goals, or system instability.

### Test Case: FSILR-002
*   **ID**: FSILR-002
*   **Description**: Verify full safety protocol: End-to-end testing of emergency stop (manual UI trigger, remote trigger if available, and autonomous trigger by critical obstacle) in CET/RFT.
*   **Pre-conditions**:
    *   Sevak is operating autonomously in CET or RFT.
    *   Manual E-Stop button on PWA UI is functional.
    *   (If applicable) Remote E-Stop device is functional.
    *   A critical, unavoidable obstacle scenario is set up for autonomous E-Stop test.
*   **Steps**:
    1.  **Given** Sevak is moving autonomously at 5 km/h.
    2.  **When** the user presses the "Emergency Stop" button on the PWA UI.
    3.  **Then** Sevak should come to a complete stop within X meters (e.g., 2 meters) and Y seconds (e.g., 3 seconds).
    4.  **And** log "EVENT:EMERGENCY_STOP_TRIGGERED SOURCE:PWA_UI_MANUAL".
    5.  **And** system enters a safe, immobile state requiring explicit reset.
    6.  **(Repeat for remote E-Stop if applicable, logging SOURCE:REMOTE_MANUAL)**
    7.  **Given** Sevak is moving autonomously at 5 km/h towards a suddenly appearing critical obstacle (e.g., large solid object dropped in its path).
    8.  **When** sensors detect the critical, unavoidable obstacle.
    9.  **Then** the autonomous emergency stop system should trigger.
    10. **And** Sevak should come to a complete stop before impact, within X meters and Y seconds.
    11. **And** log "EVENT:EMERGENCY_STOP_TRIGGERED SOURCE:AUTONOMOUS_CRITICAL_OBSTACLE".
*   **Expected Results**:
    *   All tested E-Stop mechanisms function reliably, bringing Sevak to a quick, safe stop.
    *   System logs correctly identify the source of the E-Stop.
*   **AI Verifiable Pass/Fail Criteria**:
    *   **Pass**:
        *   For each E-Stop scenario, telemetry log `sevak_safety_log_[timestamp].txt` contains:
            *   `EVENT:EMERGENCY_STOP_TRIGGERED SOURCE:[PWA_UI_MANUAL | REMOTE_MANUAL | AUTONOMOUS_CRITICAL_OBSTACLE]`.
            *   Vehicle speed telemetry shows deceleration to 0 km/h within Y seconds.
            *   Distance traveled after E-Stop trigger (calculated from GPS/odometry) is < X meters.
            *   `STATE:EMERGENCY_STOP_ACTIVE`.
        *   For autonomous E-Stop, no collision with the obstacle (verified by video/sensor data).
        *   System status API `GET /api/sevak/status` reports `{"safety_status": "emergency_stop_active"}`.
    *   **Fail**: E-Stop fails to engage, stopping distance/time exceeds limits, incorrect logging, or collision occurs in autonomous E-Stop test.

### Test Case: FSILR-003
*   **ID**: FSILR-003
*   **Description**: Stress Test: System performance and stability under peak operational load (e.g., cutting very dense fodder continuously, max transport weight on an incline) in CET.
*   **Pre-conditions**:
    *   Sevak is in CET.
    *   Task involves cutting simulated very dense fodder.
    *   Task involves transporting maximum specified payload up a defined incline (e.g., 10 degrees).
    *   Continuous operation for at least 1 hour under these conditions.
*   **Steps**:
    1.  **Given** Sevak is tasked with continuous cutting of dense fodder and transport of max payload up an incline in CET.
    2.  **When** the 1-hour stress test is initiated.
    3.  **Then** Sevak should maintain operational performance (e.g., cutting speed, travel speed) within acceptable degraded limits (e.g., not more than 25% degradation from nominal).
    4.  **And** powertrain temperatures (motor, battery) should remain within safe operational limits, with safety interlocks functioning if thresholds are neared (as per PBM tests, but verified in integrated scenario).
    5.  **And** the system should remain stable without crashes, freezes, or unexpected reboots.
    6.  **And** data logging should continue accurately.
*   **Expected Results**:
    *   Sevak completes the 1-hour stress test without critical failures or unsafe conditions.
    *   Performance degradation is within acceptable limits.
    *   System logs indicate stable operation.
*   **AI Verifiable Pass/Fail Criteria**:
    *   **Pass**:
        *   Telemetry log `sevak_stress_test_log_[timestamp].txt` shows continuous operation for >= 1.0 hour.
        *   Logged motor/battery temperatures `METRIC:MAX_MOTOR_TEMP_STRESS: [value < safe_op_limit_motor_C]` and `METRIC:MAX_BATTERY_TEMP_STRESS: [value < safe_op_limit_battery_C]`.
        *   Logged performance metrics (e.g., `avg_cutting_speed_dense_fodder`, `avg_incline_speed_max_load`) are within 75% of nominal values.
        *   No `ERR_SYSTEM_CRASH` or `ERR_UNEXPECTED_REBOOT` entries in system event logs.
        *   Data logging integrity check (e.g., on `sevak_stress_test_log`) passes.
        *   System status API `GET /api/sevak/health_check` returns `{"status": "healthy"}` throughout the test.
    *   **Fail**: System crashes, overheats beyond safe limits (interlocks fail), performance degrades by more than 25%, or data logging fails/corrupts.

### Test Case: FSILR-004
*   **ID**: FSILR-004
*   **Description**: Verify PWA connectivity and interaction with Sevak (status monitoring, task initiation/cancellation) under varying local network conditions (e.g., Wi-Fi signal strength, temporary disconnection). Also, verify OTA software update for the tractor if initiated via PWA.
*   **Pre-conditions**:
    *   Sevak PWA is connected to the Sevak tractor via local Wi-Fi.
    *   Network simulation tools can vary local Wi-Fi signal strength or simulate disconnections between PWA and tractor.
*   **Steps**:
    1.  **Given** Sevak is operating, and PWA is actively monitoring.
    2.  **When** local Wi-Fi connectivity is good.
    3.  **Then** PWA should display real-time status (location, battery, current task) with low latency (<2s update).
    4.  **And** a command (e.g., "Pause Task") sent from PWA should be executed by Sevak within Y seconds (e.g., 3s).
    5.  **When** local Wi-Fi connectivity is poor (simulated low signal, high latency).
    6.  **Then** PWA should still update status, albeit with higher latency (e.g., <10s), or indicate "Delayed Data / Weak Signal".
    7.  **And** Sevak should queue commands from PWA if immediate execution isn't possible due to transient network issues and execute when connectivity improves or confirm failure gracefully.
    8.  **When** local Wi-Fi connectivity is temporarily lost for Z seconds (e.g., 30 seconds).
    9.  **Then** Sevak should continue autonomous operation safely (if ongoing task).
    10. **And** PWA should indicate "Connection Lost to Sevak".
    11. **And** upon reconnection, PWA should re-establish communication and sync status. Queued commands (if any) should be processed or re-confirmed.
    12. **(If OTA Update for Tractor is initiated via PWA)** **When** an OTA software update for the tractor is initiated from the PWA.
    13. **Then** the PWA should securely transmit the update command/package (or trigger download on tractor).
    14. **And** Sevak tractor should download, verify, and apply the update securely, reboot if necessary.
    15. **And** PWA should display update progress and final status (success/failure).
    16. **And** Sevak tractor log contains `EVENT:OTA_UPDATE_SUCCESSFUL VERSION:[new_version]`.
*   **Expected Results**:
    *   PWA interactions are functional and robust across varying local network conditions.
    *   Sevak handles local connectivity issues gracefully.
    *   OTA updates for the tractor (if applicable via PWA) are reliable and secure.
*   **AI Verifiable Pass/Fail Criteria**:
    *   **Pass**:
        *   PWA browser console logs and/or tractor logs confirm:
            *   Status updates received by PWA within specified latencies for good/poor connectivity. `PWA_LOG:STATUS_UPDATE_RECEIVED LATENCY:[value]` or `TRACTOR_LOG:STATUS_SENT_TO_PWA`.
            *   Commands sent from PWA (e.g., `PWA_LOG:CMD_PAUSE_TASK_SENT`) acknowledged by tractor and tractor's operational log shows corresponding action (`TRACTOR_LOG:EVENT:TASK_PAUSED_BY_PWA_CMD`).
        *   Sevak's system log shows graceful handling of PWA connection loss/restoration: `TRACTOR_LOG:EVENT:PWA_CONNECTION_LOST`, `TRACTOR_LOG:EVENT:PWA_CONNECTION_RESTORED`.
        *   PWA UI correctly reflects connection status changes.
        *   For OTA via PWA: Tractor system log contains `EVENT:OTA_UPDATE_INITIATED_BY_PWA`, `EVENT:OTA_DOWNLOAD_COMPLETE`, `EVENT:OTA_SIGNATURE_VERIFIED_OK`, `EVENT:OTA_INSTALL_SUCCESS`, `EVENT:SYSTEM_REBOOT_POST_OTA`, `CURRENT_SW_VERSION:[new_version]`. PWA displays corresponding success message. Tractor's version API (if available to PWA) `GET /api/sevak/version` reports the new version.
    *   **Fail**: PWA status not updating, commands failing, Sevak/PWA instability due to connectivity issues, OTA update failure, or incorrect logging. Critical browser console errors in PWA.
