# Framework Scaffold Report: Sevak Mobile Companion Application

**Date:** 2025-05-23
**Project:** Sevak - Autonomous Electric Fodder Cutting & Transport Mini-Tractor
**Component:** Mobile Companion Application (PWA)

## 1. Overview

This report details the initial framework scaffolding activities undertaken for the Sevak Mobile Companion Application. The goal of this phase was to establish the foundational structure of the PWA, leveraging the `mvllow/next-pwa-template`, and prepare it for subsequent feature development as outlined in [`docs/PRDMasterPlan.md`](docs/PRDMasterPlan.md) and [`docs/architecture/system_architecture.md`](docs/architecture/system_architecture.md).

All scaffolding tasks were delegated to specialized AI worker agents, and their outcomes have been verified.

## 2. Scaffolding Activities & Outcomes

### 2.1. DevOps Foundations Setup

*   **Objective:** Create the primary directory for the mobile application and clone the base PWA template.
*   **Actions Performed by `devops-foundations-setup` agent:**
    *   Created a new directory: [`mobile-app/`](mobile-app/)
    *   Cloned the `mvllow/next-pwa-template` (from https://github.com/mvllow/next-pwa-template.git) into [`mobile-app/`](mobile-app/).
*   **AI Verifiable Outcome:**
    *   Existence of the [`mobile-app/`](mobile-app/) directory.
    *   Existence of key template files within [`mobile-app/`](mobile-app/), including:
        *   [`mobile-app/package.json`](mobile-app/package.json)
        *   [`mobile-app/next.config.js`](mobile-app/next.config.js)
        *   [`mobile-app/public/manifest.json`](mobile-app/public/manifest.json)
        *   [`mobile-app/pages/`](mobile-app/pages/) directory
        *   [`mobile-app/components/`](mobile-app/components/) directory
*   **Status:** Completed and Verified.

### 2.2. Framework Boilerplate Customization

*   **Objective:** Update the cloned boilerplate with Sevak-specific branding and configuration.
*   **Actions Performed by `coder-framework-boilerplate` agent:**
    *   Modified [`mobile-app/public/manifest.json`](mobile-app/public/manifest.json) with:
        *   `name`: "Sevak Mobile Companion"
        *   `short_name`: "SevakApp"
        *   `theme_color`: "#38761D"
        *   `background_color`: "#FFFFFF"
        *   `description`: "Companion application for the Sevak autonomous electric fodder mini-tractor."
        *   Ensured `icons` array references valid placeholder icons from the template (e.g., `/images/icon-192.png`, `/images/icon-512.png`).
    *   Verified the existence of [`mobile-app/pages/index.tsx`](mobile-app/pages/index.tsx).
*   **AI Verifiable Outcome:**
    *   [`mobile-app/public/manifest.json`](mobile-app/public/manifest.json) updated as specified.
    *   [`mobile-app/pages/index.tsx`](mobile-app/pages/index.tsx) exists.
*   **Status:** Completed and Verified.

### 2.3. Test Harness Setup

*   **Objective:** Establish a basic testing framework and initial test structure for the mobile application.
*   **Actions Performed by `tester-tdd-master` agent:**
    *   Identified that no testing framework was present in the template.
    *   Installed and configured Jest and React Testing Library. Dependencies added to [`mobile-app/package.json`](mobile-app/package.json): `@types/jest`, `ts-jest`, `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`, `jest-environment-jsdom`.
    *   Added `test` script (`"jest"`) to [`mobile-app/package.json`](mobile-app/package.json).
    *   Created Jest configuration file: [`mobile-app/jest.config.js`](mobile-app/jest.config.js).
    *   Created Jest setup file: [`mobile-app/jest.setup.js`](mobile-app/jest.setup.js) (imports `@testing-library/jest-dom`).
    *   Created mock files: [`mobile-app/__mocks__/fileMock.js`](mobile-app/__mocks__/fileMock.js) and [`mobile-app/__mocks__/next/router.js`](mobile-app/__mocks__/next/router.js).
    *   Updated [`mobile-app/tsconfig.json`](mobile-app/tsconfig.json) to include Jest types and process JS mock files.
    *   Created test directory: [`mobile-app/__tests__/`](mobile-app/__tests__/).
    *   Created initial test file: [`mobile-app/__tests__/index.test.tsx`](mobile-app/__tests__/index.test.tsx) with a basic render check for a heading on the main page.
*   **AI Verifiable Outcome:**
    *   Testing dependencies present in [`mobile-app/package.json`](mobile-app/package.json).
    *   Existence of [`mobile-app/jest.config.js`](mobile-app/jest.config.js) and [`mobile-app/jest.setup.js`](mobile-app/jest.setup.js).
    *   Existence of [`mobile-app/__tests__/`](mobile-app/__tests__/) and [`mobile-app/__tests__/index.test.tsx`](mobile-app/__tests__/index.test.tsx).
    *   Test command (`npm test` or `yarn test`) runs successfully within [`mobile-app/`](mobile-app/) and the initial test passes.
*   **Status:** Completed and Verified.

## 3. Initial Project Structure (`mobile-app/`)

As a result of these scaffolding activities, the [`mobile-app/`](mobile-app/) directory now contains:

*   The complete structure of the `mvllow/next-pwa-template`.
*   A customized `public/manifest.json` for Sevak.
*   A configured Jest and React Testing Library test environment.
*   An initial passing test case for the main page.

Key files and directories include:
*   `package.json` (with testing dependencies)
*   `next.config.js`
*   `tsconfig.json` (updated for Jest)
*   `jest.config.js`
*   `jest.setup.js`
*   `public/`
    *   `manifest.json` (customized)
    *   `icons/` (or `images/` as per template, containing placeholder icons)
*   `pages/`
    *   `index.tsx`
*   `components/`
*   `__tests__/`
    *   `index.test.tsx`
*   `__mocks__/`
    *   `fileMock.js`
    *   `next/router.js`

## 4. Next Steps

The Sevak Mobile Companion Application framework is now scaffolded. Subsequent development will focus on:

*   Implementing UI components as per design specifications.
*   Developing application logic for features outlined in [`docs/PRDMasterPlan.md`](docs/PRDMasterPlan.md).
*   Integrating communication logic with the Sevak Tractor Unit.
*   Expanding test coverage following TDD principles.

This report serves as a record of the initial framework setup and confirms readiness for the next phase of development.
