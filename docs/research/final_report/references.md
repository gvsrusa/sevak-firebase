# References

This document will compile all sources cited throughout the Project Sevak strategic research report.

*(This section will be populated systematically as findings are documented and sources are identified from the AI search tool outputs and other research activities. Each entry will aim for a consistent citation style.)*

## Format (Example)

*   **[Source ID]** Author(s). (Year). *Title of Work*. Publisher/Journal, Volume(Issue), Pages. URL (if applicable)

## Collected References

*(This list will be expanded and detailed as the research progresses and sources are fully processed. The numeric IDs used in the `primary_findings` documents (e.g., [1], [2]) are temporary placeholders based on the order of information presented by the AI search tool for a given query and will be mapped to full citations here.)*
