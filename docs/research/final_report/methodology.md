# Research Methodology

This section details the methodology employed for the strategic research conducted for Project Sevak.

## 1. Research Objectives and Scope Definition

*   The initial phase involved a thorough review of the Project Sevak user blueprint ([`docs/blueprint.md`](../../docs/blueprint.md)) to understand the core requirements and functionalities of the proposed autonomous electric fodder cutting and transport mini-tractor.
*   Based on this understanding, a detailed research scope was defined in [`docs/research/initial_queries/scope_definition.md`](../../docs/research/initial_queries/scope_definition.md), outlining the key areas of investigation:
    *   Autonomous Operation & Navigation
    *   Fodder Cutting Mechanism
    *   Electric Powertrain & Energy Management
    *   Task Management System & UI/UX
    *   Manual Control System
    *   Obstacle Avoidance
    *   Data Logging & Farm Management Insights
    *   Mini-Tractor Platform Design
    *   Existing Solutions & Market Landscape
    *   Challenges & Risks

## 2. Formulation of Key Research Questions

*   A comprehensive list of key research questions was developed, corresponding to each area within the defined scope. These questions, documented in [`docs/research/initial_queries/key_questions.md`](../../docs/research/initial_queries/key_questions.md), were designed to guide the data collection process.

## 3. Identification of Information Sources

*   Potential information sources were brainstormed and listed in [`docs/research/initial_queries/information_sources.md`](../../docs/research/initial_queries/information_sources.md). These included academic databases, industry publications, market research reports, competitor analyses, open-source projects, and regulatory bodies.
*   The primary tool for accessing and querying these diverse sources was an advanced AI search capability (Perplexity AI, accessed via an MCP tool).

## 4. Data Collection (Initial Cycle)

*   Iterative search queries were formulated based on the key research questions and executed using the AI search tool.
*   The search results, including summaries and cited sources, were systematically documented in a series of `primary_findings_part_X.md` files located in [`docs/research/data_collection/`](../../docs/research/data_collection/). This multi-file approach was adopted to ensure individual markdown files remained manageable in size.
*   (Placeholder for Secondary Findings: If secondary research (e.g., deep dives into specific cited papers) were conducted, these would be documented in `secondary_findings_part_X.md` files.)

## 5. Data Analysis and Synthesis (Iterative Process)

*   **First Pass Analysis and Gap Identification:**
    *   The collected primary findings were reviewed to identify initial patterns, potential contradictions, and expert insights.
    *   Placeholder documents were created for this analysis:
        *   [`docs/research/analysis/expert_insights.md`](../../docs/research/analysis/expert_insights.md)
        *   [`docs/research/analysis/identified_patterns.md`](../../docs/research/analysis/identified_patterns.md)
        *   [`docs/research/analysis/contradictions.md`](../../docs/research/analysis/contradictions.md)
    *   Crucially, a [`docs/research/analysis/knowledge_gaps.md`](../../docs/research/analysis/knowledge_gaps.md) document was established to list unanswered questions and areas requiring deeper investigation.
*   **(Placeholder for Targeted Research Cycles):** The `knowledge_gaps.md` document is designed to drive recursive, targeted research cycles. For each significant gap, specific queries would be formulated and executed, with new findings integrated back into the `primary_findings` and `secondary_findings` documents (potentially as new parts or appended to existing ones, respecting file size limits). The analysis documents would then be updated. This iterative process continues until knowledge gaps are sufficiently addressed or operational constraints are met. (For this initial report generation, we are assuming one primary cycle of data collection).
*   **Synthesis:**
    *   Once data collection and analysis reach a satisfactory stage, findings are synthesized. Placeholder documents for this stage include:
        *   [`docs/research/synthesis/integrated_model.md`](../../docs/research/synthesis/integrated_model.md): To develop a cohesive understanding of the system.
        *   [`docs/research/synthesis/key_insights.md`](../../docs/research/synthesis/key_insights.md): To distill strategic takeaways.
        *   [`docs/research/synthesis/practical_applications.md`](../../docs/research/synthesis/practical_applications.md): To translate insights into actionable recommendations.

## 6. Final Report Generation

*   The final strategic research report is compiled from all preceding documentation.
*   The structure includes an Executive Summary, Introduction (incorporating scope and methodology), Detailed Findings (consolidating `primary_findings` and `secondary_findings`), In-Depth Analysis (consolidating `expert_insights`, `identified_patterns`, `contradictions`, `knowledge_gaps`), Synthesis (consolidating `integrated_model`, `key_insights`), Recommendations (derived from `practical_applications`), Conclusion, and References.
*   The Table of Contents ([`docs/research/final_report/table_of_contents.md`](../table_of_contents.md)) provides navigation for the entire report, linking to all constituent files and their parts if split.
*   A dedicated [`docs/research/final_report/references.md`](../references.md) file will compile all cited sources.

## 7. Adherence to Constraints

*   **Natural Language:** All research documents are written in clear, natural language suitable for human programmers and stakeholders.
*   **File Size Management:** Individual content files are kept to a manageable line count, with larger conceptual documents split into sequentially named physical files (e.g., `primary_findings_part_1.md`, `primary_findings_part_2.md`).
*   **Structured Documentation:** A predefined hierarchical directory structure is used for all research outputs within the `docs/research/` subdirectory.

This methodology aims to ensure a comprehensive, structured, and iterative research process, allowing for depth, accuracy, and the systematic identification and filling of knowledge gaps.
