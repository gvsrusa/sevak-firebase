# Detailed Research Findings for Project Sevak (Part 1)

This section consolidates the detailed findings from the primary (and any secondary) research conducted for Project Sevak. It covers the core areas of investigation as outlined in the research scope.

*(This document, and its subsequent parts, will be populated by integrating and structuring the content from all `docs/research/data_collection/primary_findings_part_X.md` files and any `secondary_findings_part_X.md` files. The content will be organized thematically according to the key research questions.)*

## Chapter 1: Autonomous Operation & Navigation

*(Content from [`docs/research/data_collection/primary_findings_part_1.md`](../../data_collection/primary_findings_part_1.md) will be integrated here, potentially expanded with secondary findings if applicable. This section will cover SOTA navigation algorithms, sensor requirements, challenges in GPS-variable environments, and management of predefined operational zones.)*
