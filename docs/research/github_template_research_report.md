# GitHub Template Research Report: Sevak Project

## 1. Introduction

This report details the research conducted to find a suitable GitHub project template for the Sevak project. The goal is to identify a template that can accelerate development by providing a solid foundation for the Next.js-based mobile companion application, which requires PWA capabilities, map integration, real-time data display, and a user-friendly control dashboard.

## 2. Search Strategy

The primary search strategy involved using the GitHub API to search for repositories with relevant keywords.

**Initial Search Keywords:**
* "Next.js PWA template"
* "Next.js PWA dashboard template"

## 3. Templates Considered

### 3.1. `mvllow/next-pwa-template`
*   **URL:** [https://github.com/mvllow/next-pwa-template](https://github.com/mvllow/next-pwa-template)
*   **Description (from GitHub):** Next.js progressive web app template
*   **Key Dependencies (from `package.json`):**
    *   `next`: "14.1.1"
    *   `next-pwa`: "^5.6.0"
    *   `next-themes`: "^0.2.1"
    *   `react`: "18.2.0"
    *   `tailwindcss`: "^3.3.3"
    *   `typescript`: "^5.2.2"
*   **Initial Assessment:** **Strong candidate.** Explicit `next-pwa` dependency, a `next.config.js` confirming PWA setup (`next-pwa` wrapper with `register: true`, `skipWaiting: true`), and a `public/manifest.json` are all present. The `readme.md` (found on second attempt) confirms features like Next.js 13 (package.json has 14.1.1), Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, `next-themes`, and a "fluffless" approach. This aligns very well with the Sevak project's technical stack and PWA requirements.

### 3.2. `agustinusnathaniel/nextarter-tailwind`
*   **URL:** [https://github.com/agustinusnathaniel/nextarter-tailwind](https://github.com/agustinusnathaniel/nextarter-tailwind)
*   **Description (from GitHub):** battery packed template / boilerplate to initialize PWA ready Next.js app with TailwindCSS & Typescript setup âœ¨
*   **Key Dependencies (from `package.json`):**
    *   `next`: "^15.3.2"
    *   `next-themes`: "^0.4.6"
    *   `react`: "19.1.0"
    *   `tailwindcss`: "^4.1.6"
    *   `typescript`: "5.8.3"
    *   `lucide-react`: "^0.510.0" (for icons)
    *   `next-sitemap`: "^4.2.3"
*   **Initial Assessment:** Promising due to its claim of PWA readiness, modern Next.js version, and inclusion of Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, theming, and icons. However, `next.config.js/mjs` and `public/manifest.json` were not found at their standard root locations, making its PWA setup less immediately verifiable without deeper code/structure analysis.

### 3.3. `ivandotv/nextjs-material-pwa`
*   **URL:** [https://github.com/ivandotv/nextjs-material-pwa](https://github.com/ivandotv/nextjs-material-pwa)
*   **Description (from GitHub):** Template for creating progressive web apps with MaterialUI, Next.js and Workbox
*   **Key Dependencies (from `package.json`):**
    *   `next`: "canary"
    *   `@mui/material`: "^5.8.3"
    *   `workbox-core`: "^6.5.3" (and other workbox modules)
    *   `nextjs-workbox-config`: "^2.0.0"
    *   `react`: "18.1.0"
    *   `typescript`: "^4.7.3"
*   **Initial Assessment:** This template explicitly uses Workbox for PWA capabilities and Next.js. However, it uses Material UI for its component library, which differs from the Sevak project's current use of Tailwind CSS. This makes it less ideal for direct integration without significant UI rework.

### 3.4. `Bhanu1776/Nextjs15-Starter-Template`
*   **URL:** [https://github.com/Bhanu1776/Nextjs15-Starter-Template](https://github.com/Bhanu1776/Nextjs15-Starter-Template)
*   **Description (from GitHub):** Npm package: Latest Next.js 15 starter template with Typescript + Tailwindcss + Eslint + Prettier + Husky + pnpm + PWA ðŸ”¥
*   **Key Dependencies (from `package.json`):**
    *   `next`: "15.2.5"
    *   `next-pwa`: "^5.6.0"
    *   `react`: "19.0.0"
    *   `tailwindcss`: "^3.4.17"
    *   `typescript`: "5.7.3"
*   **Initial Assessment:** This template is a strong candidate. It uses `next-pwa`, a recent version of Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript, aligning perfectly with the Sevak project's technical stack. It also includes a `public/manifest.json`. The `next.config.js/mjs` was not found at the root, so PWA plugin integration details are less immediately clear than `mvllow/next-pwa-template`, but the presence of `next-pwa` in `package.json` and a `manifest.json` is positive.

*(No new templates were found with the "dashboard" specific query that met initial criteria better than existing candidates.)*

| **Structure**         | Pages Router               | Likely Pages (based on Next.js ver)   | Likely Pages (based on Next.js ver)   | Acceptable (Sevak uses App Router) |
| **Documentation**     | `readme.md` (basic)        | Minimal (npm page)                    | `README.md` (good)                    | Basic is okay, integration is key |
| **"Fluff"**           | Low ("fluffless")          | Appears minimal                       | Appears minimal, "battery packed"     | Low fluff preferred               |

**Summary of Comparison:**

*   **`mvllow/next-pwa-template`:** Emerges as the strongest candidate due to its clear and verifiable PWA setup using `next-pwa`, a complete set of standard PWA files (`next.config.js`, `manifest.json`), and good alignment with the core technologies (Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript). Its "fluffless" nature is a plus. The main consideration is its use of the Pages Router, while the existing Sevak project uses the App Router.
*   **`Bhanu1776/Nextjs15-Starter-Template`:** A strong contender as well, with `next-pwa` and `manifest.json`. The lack of an easily found `next.config.js/mjs` at the root makes its PWA plugin integration slightly less transparent initially, but the core PWA dependency is there. Uses a newer Next.js version.
*   **`agustinusnathaniel/nextarter-tailwind`:** While claiming PWA readiness and having a good feature set (including icons), the PWA implementation details (plugin, manifest, config) were not immediately verifiable through standard file checks at the root level, making it a slightly higher risk without deeper code inspection.

## 5. Rationale for Decision

The decision is to recommend **`mvllow/next-pwa-template`** for integration into the Sevak project.

**Reasons:**

1.  **Clear PWA Implementation:** The template uses `next-pwa` and has a well-defined PWA setup visible in `next.config.js` and `public/manifest.json`. This provides high confidence in its PWA capabilities, which is a core requirement.
2.  **Technology Stack Alignment:** It uses Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript, matching the Sevak project's existing frontend stack. This will ease integration and leverage existing team knowledge.
3.  **"Fluffless" Approach:** The template aims to be minimal, reducing the effort needed to strip out unnecessary features and adapt it to the project's specific needs.
4.  **Sufficient Foundation:** While it doesn't include dashboard-specific UI components or map integrations (which are highly application-specific), it provides a solid, PWA-enabled foundation upon which these features can be built.
5.  **Acceptable Next.js Version:** While not the absolute latest, Next.js 14.1.1 is modern and stable.

The primary consideration for integration will be the difference in routing (Pages Router in the template vs. App Router potentially in the existing Sevak project structure if the mobile app is to be tightly coupled). This will need to be addressed during integration, either by adopting the Pages Router for the PWA or by adapting the template's PWA setup to an App Router structure. Given the template's focus, adopting its Pages Router structure for the standalone PWA companion app might be the more straightforward path.

The confidence level for this template significantly accelerating development by providing a robust PWA foundation is high (approximately 80-85%).

## 6. Conclusion

`mvllow/next-pwa-template` is recommended for integration. It offers the best balance of clear PWA functionality, technology stack alignment, and a minimal starting point for the Sevak mobile companion application. The next step is to create a detailed integration guide.
