This document continues to capture initial findings for Project Sevak, focusing on fodder cutting mechanisms.

## 6. Fodder Cutting Mechanisms for Electric Autonomous Mini-Tractors

The selection of an appropriate fodder cutting mechanism for an electric autonomous mini-tractor like Sevak involves balancing energy efficiency, cutting performance across various fodder types, reliability, low maintenance, and safety.

### A. Types of Cutting Mechanisms

*   **Rotary Disc Mowers:**
    *   **Principle:** Utilize multiple discs, each with free-swinging knives, rotating at high speeds. They are known for providing a clean and consistent cut.
    *   **Efficiency & Power:** Generally considered energy-efficient for their cutting capacity. Sabanto’s autonomous mowing operations suggest compatibility with electric tractor endurance goals [2].
    *   **Power Consumption Estimate:** Approximately 2–4 kWh per acre, varying with crop density and conditions [2, 5 - inferred].
    *   **Optimization:** Blade angle, sharpness, and rotational speed can be adjusted. Slower speeds might be used for delicate grasses (e.g., alfalfa), while higher speeds might be needed for denser or tougher fodder.
    *   **Maintenance:** Relatively straightforward; primarily involves blade sharpening or replacement.
*   **Flail Cutters:**
    *   **Principle:** A horizontal rotor with numerous "flails" (T-shaped or Y-shaped knives) that shred vegetation.
    *   **Suitability:** Effective for coarser, mixed, or overgrown fodder and can handle small debris better than disc mowers. The robustness seen in systems like Raven Industries’ autonomous tillage equipment highlights the importance of durable mechanical designs for harsh farm conditions [3 - by analogy].
    *   **Power Consumption Estimate:** Higher energy demand compared to disc mowers, roughly 5–7 kWh per acre, due to the shredding action and higher torque requirements [5 - inferred]. This would have a more significant impact on vehicle endurance.
    *   **Maintenance:** Flails need regular inspection for wear and damage.
*   **Reciprocating Bar (Sickle Bar) Cutters:**
    *   **Principle:** Uses a bar with triangular blades that move back and forth in a shearing action against stationary guard fingers.
    *   **Suitability:** Good for precision cutting and can operate effectively in orchards or vineyards, as suggested by the targeted operational capabilities of systems like Bobcat’s AT450X, which uses AI to adapt to specific environments [5].
    *   **Efficiency:** Generally low power consumption due to lower inertia and a slicing action rather than high-speed impact. This is beneficial for preserving battery life on electric vehicles.
    *   **Maintenance:** Can be more complex due to more moving parts; requires careful alignment and blade sharpening.

### B. Impact on Vehicle Endurance

*   **Battery Systems & Management:** The choice of cutting mechanism directly influences battery drain. Companies like Monarch Tractor with their MK-V electric tractor focus on modular batteries optimized for high-draw agricultural tasks, aiming for runtimes of 8–12 hours [4].
*   **Regenerative Braking:** While not directly related to the cutting mechanism itself, energy recovery during non-cutting phases (e.g., transport, turning) can extend overall operational time by an estimated 15% in some electric agricultural vehicles [5 - inferred general EV benefit].
*   **Task Scheduling & Optimization:** Autonomous systems, like Sabanto’s, can allow for intelligent task scheduling. For example, prioritizing energy-intensive cutting tasks during periods of optimal solar charging (if applicable) or when battery levels are high [2].

### C. Optimization for Different Fodder Types

The cutting mechanism should ideally be adaptable or selectable based on the fodder.

| Fodder Type        | Recommended Mechanism(s) | Key Adjustments/Considerations                                  |
|--------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Delicate Grasses   | Rotary Disc, Reciprocating Bar | Reduced blade speed (rotary), sharp blades, proper alignment. |
| Fibrous/Tough Crops| Flail Cutter, Rotary Disc (heavy-duty) | Increased RPM/power (flail), reinforced blades, robust construction. |
| Mixed Vegetation   | Flail Cutter, Reciprocating Bar | Variable stroke length (reciprocating), durable flails.         |

The adaptability seen in technologies like Raven’s prescription tillage, which adjusts to soil conditions [3], provides a conceptual model for how a cutting system might use sensors (e.g., torque sensors on the cutting motor, optical sensors for fodder density) to dynamically adjust its parameters.

### D. Safety Considerations for Autonomous Cutting

Autonomous operation necessitates robust safety features:

*   **Obstacle Detection & Avoidance:** Critical for preventing collisions with unexpected objects (rocks, debris, animals, humans). Systems like Sabanto’s utilize cameras and LiDAR to detect obstacles and halt operations [2]. The Bobcat AT450X also features AI-driven obstacle detection [5].
*   **Emergency Shutdown Systems:**
    *   **Remote Killswitch:** Allows an operator to stop the machine remotely in an emergency [2, 5].
    *   **Physical E-stops:** Easily accessible emergency stop buttons on the vehicle itself.
*   **Geofencing:** Essential for ensuring the autonomous tractor operates only within predefined boundaries, preventing it from straying into unsafe areas or off the designated cutting zone [2].
*   **Sensor Integrity Checks:** Continuous monitoring of sensor health to ensure the perception system is functioning correctly.
*   **Fail-Safe Mechanisms:** If critical sensors fail or an unrecoverable error occurs, the system should default to a safe state (e.g., stop, alert operator).

## 7. Case Study Insights Related to Cutting/Mowing

*   **Monarch Tractor MK-V:** While primarily highlighted for feed-pushing, its deployment on dairy farms and emphasis on low-maintenance electric operation with significant daily energy cost savings (60% lower than diesel) are relevant for an electric fodder cutter [4].
*   **Bobcat AT450X:** Its AI-powered vision for obstacle-free mowing in vineyards and autonomous battery swapping for continuous workflow demonstrate advanced capabilities applicable to autonomous fodder cutting [5].
*   **Sabanto Retrofit Kits:** Farmers using Sabanto's autonomous rotary mowing systems have reported a 30% reduction in fodder waste, indicating the potential for precision and efficiency gains with autonomous cutting [2].
