# Primary Findings: Autonomous Agricultural Vehicles (Part 4)

This document continues to capture initial findings for Project Sevak, focusing on task management systems and UI/UX design for autonomous agricultural vehicles.

## 9. Task Management System & UI/UX Design

Designing an intuitive and effective task management system with a user-friendly interface is crucial for the adoption and efficient operation of autonomous agricultural vehicles like Sevak, especially considering operators may not be tech-savvy and will use the system in outdoor conditions.

### A. Core Design Principles for Agricultural UI/UX

*   **User-Centered Workflow Integration:**
    *   Interfaces should align with existing farming practices rather than imposing entirely new, complex workflows [3, 5].
    *   **Visual Grid Systems:** Overlaying maps with grid systems that match real-world field dimensions (e.g., acre-based or user-defined grids) can aid in spatial understanding and task definition [3, 5].
    *   **Drag-and-Drop Functionality:** Allowing users to define task zones (cutting areas, drop-off points, home base) by dragging and dropping shapes onto a map, with automatic snapping to geographic features (e.g., field boundaries, hedgerows), simplifies input [1].
    *   **Progressive Disclosure:** Presenting only essential controls and information upfront, with advanced options or settings accessible through contextual menus or clearly marked "advanced" sections, prevents overwhelming novice users [5].
*   **Outdoor Visibility and Usability:**
    *   **High-Contrast Visuals:** Employing color schemes with high contrast (e.g., dark greens/browns for terrain, bright colors for active elements) is essential for readability in direct sunlight and reducing glare [1, 5]. The Sevak blueprint's choice of forest green, light beige, and warm gold should be tested for outdoor visibility.
    *   **Large Touch Targets & Clear Fonts:** Buttons, icons, and interactive elements must be large enough for easy touch interaction, even with gloved hands. Clean, sans-serif fonts with high readability are critical [Blueprint].
    *   **Dynamic Zoom & Panning:** The map interface should allow easy zooming and panning, potentially with an auto-zoom feature that focuses on the active work area or vehicle location to reduce map clutter and improve focus.
    *   **Tactile Feedback (Hybrid Interfaces):** For critical controls (e.g., emergency stop, mode switch), incorporating physical buttons or joysticks alongside a touchscreen can improve usability, especially with gloves or in wet conditions [3].
*   **Contextual Data Layering and Information Display:**
    *   **Clear Status Indicators:** Use universally understood icons and color-coding for vehicle status (e.g., cutting, transporting, charging, error). For example:
        *   Green: Operational / Task in Progress
        *   Blue: Task Completed / Idle
        *   Yellow: Low Battery / Warning / Refuel Needed [5]
        *   Red: Error / Mechanical Fault / Emergency Stop [5]
    *   **Essential Information Prominence:** Key data like tractor status, battery level (percentage and estimated runtime), and current GPS location must be clearly and persistently displayed [4, Blueprint].
    *   **Intuitive Icons:** Use bold, simple, and easily recognizable icons that provide an intuitive understanding of functions, minimizing reliance on text labels [Blueprint].

### B. Task Definition Mechanisms for Map-Based Interfaces

*   **Path Planning Input:**
    *   **Manual Tracing:** Allow users to draw paths directly on the map for irregular fields or specific routes.
    *   **Waypoint Selection:** Define paths by selecting a sequence of waypoints.
    *   **AI-Assisted Patterns:** Offer predefined patterns (e.g., contour following, spiral paths for coverage, back-and-forth for area cutting) that the system can adapt to the defined zone [2, 5].
    *   **Historical Path Reuse:** Enable saving and reloading previously used paths or task configurations, with options to easily adjust them [2, 5].
*   **Operational Zone Definition (Cutting Areas, Drop-off, Home Base):**
    *   **Polygon Drawing Tools:** Allow users to draw custom polygonal zones on the map.
    *   **Predefined Shapes:** Offer tools to quickly create rectangular or circular zones.
    *   **Smart Boundary Detection (Advanced):** Potentially leverage GPS fence creation (e.g., with ~30cm accuracy), computer vision for recognizing existing field boundaries or crop rows, or even integrate with soil moisture sensor data to define variable rate application zones (though less relevant for cutting) [3, 4].
*   **Error Prevention and Correction:**
    *   **Automated Conflict Checks:** The system should alert users to impossible or conflicting task definitions (e.g., overlapping operational zones, paths leading outside defined boundaries).
    *   **Undo/Redo Functionality:** A clear undo/redo stack, possibly with a visual timeline of actions, is crucial for allowing users to correct mistakes easily [5].
    *   **Haptic or Audible Alerts:** Provide feedback for actions, especially for confirming critical inputs or alerting to potential errors (e.g., trying to create an impossible path) [1].

### C. Adoption-Focused UX Strategies for Non-Tech-Savvy Users

*   **Familiar Interaction Patterns:**
    *   If possible, incorporate control paradigms that might be familiar from other agricultural equipment or consumer applications (e.g., simple joystick-like controls for manual override, intuitive swipe gestures on maps) [3].
    *   Ensure hardware (if a dedicated device is used) is robust and weather-resistant, matching the durability standards of existing farm equipment [4].
*   **Progressive Complexity Levels / User Modes:**
    *   **Novice/Basic Mode:** Guided setup, preconfigured field templates, simplified task options [1, 5].
    *   **Intermediate Mode:** Access to more editing tools, path optimization suggestions.
    *   **Expert/Advanced Mode:** Full control over all parameters, potentially with access to raw sensor data overlays or detailed configuration settings [1, 5].
*   **Trust-Building Elements:**
    *   **Live Camera Feeds:** Displaying a live video feed from the vehicle's perspective can increase operator confidence and situational awareness [5].
    *   **Predictive Status Explanations:** Instead of cryptic error codes, provide clear, plain-language explanations for system actions or pauses (e.g., "Pausing task: Obstacle detected ahead," or "Low battery: Returning to home base for charging") [5].
    *   **Accessible Logs & History:** Allow users to easily review past operations, errors, and maintenance logs, perhaps annotated on the map interface [3].
*   **Training and Support:**
    *   In-app tutorials, tooltips, and a readily accessible help section.
    *   Clear, concise user manuals with visual aids.

### D. Evaluation and Iteration Methods

Effective UI/UX design is an iterative process. Research highlights several evaluation methods:

1.  **Heuristic Evaluation:** HCI experts assess the interface against established usability principles to identify potential issues (e.g., icon clarity, consistency) [1, 5].
2.  **Cognitive Walkthroughs:** Designers and representative users step through typical tasks to evaluate the ease of learning and identify points of confusion [1, 5].
3.  **User Testing with Farmers:** Involves observing farmers performing tasks with the interface in simulated or real field conditions. Key metrics include:
    *   Task setup time and completion success rate.
    *   Error frequency, especially under challenging conditions (e.g., dusk/dawn, glare).
    *   User satisfaction and confidence surveys [1, 5].

A study at the University of Manitoba on an autonomous sprayer interface demonstrated a 42% reduction in task configuration errors after iterative design cycles incorporating farmer feedback, particularly on color symbolism and control grouping [1]. Research by DIVA Portal indicated 37% faster adoption rates for agricultural systems using hybrid physical/digital input methods compared to touchscreen-only designs, suggesting the value of tactile controls for certain functions [2 - by inference on adoption].

By prioritizing contextual awareness, fail-safe interactions, clear information hierarchy, and progressive complexity, the Sevak task management system can be designed to enhance farm productivity while respecting operators' existing expertise and minimizing the learning curve [3, 5].
