# Primary Findings: Autonomous Agricultural Vehicles (Part 8)

This document continues to capture initial findings for Project Sevak, focusing on the mini-tractor platform design.

## 13. Mini-Tractor Platform Design

The physical platform of an autonomous electric mini-tractor like Sevak must be engineered for stability, maneuverability, and durability to withstand harsh agricultural environments while performing its tasks effectively.

### A. Key Design Considerations for Chassis

*   **Stability:**
    *   **Low Center of Gravity (CoG):** Essential for operating on uneven terrain and slopes. The placement of heavy components, particularly the battery pack in an electric vehicle, significantly influences CoG. Strategic placement, often low and central, is key. Monarch Tractor's design, for instance, incorporates a by-wire platform inspired by flight control systems, which likely aids in dynamic stability and weight distribution management [2].
    *   **Track Width and Wheelbase:** A wider track width generally improves lateral stability, while a longer wheelbase enhances longitudinal stability. Some designs, like the CAKE Kibb, feature a modular design with adjustable track width (e.g., 1,000–1,200 mm), allowing adaptation to different row crop spacings or terrain conditions, which can also contribute to stability [3, 4].
    *   **Suspension System:** While simpler mini-tractors might have rigid axles, a basic suspension system (e.g., leaf springs, independent wheel suspension on some advanced models) can improve stability by maintaining wheel contact on uneven ground, reduce vibrations protecting sensitive electronic components, and enhance operator comfort if a manned option exists.
*   **Maneuverability:**
    *   **Turning Radius:** A small turning radius is critical for operating in confined spaces like greenhouses, orchards, or small fields with tight headlands. The CAKE Kibb is noted for its low turning radius [3]. The QFD (Quality Function Deployment) analysis in one study identified turning radius as a critical design factor [4].
    *   **Overall Dimensions:** A "mini-tractor" implies compact dimensions for better access and reduced soil compaction.
    *   **Steering System:** Precise and responsive steering is crucial. Electric power steering is common in modern designs. For autonomous operation, steer-by-wire systems are necessary. Monarch Tractor's hydraulic system and by-wire controls likely allow for precise steering [2].
*   **Durability:**
    *   **Frame Construction:** Robust frame design using materials like high-strength steel or aluminum alloys to withstand operational stresses, vibrations, and potential impacts. Welded and/or bolted construction methods are chosen based on strength, repairability, and cost.
    *   **Component Protection:**
        *   Sensitive components (electronics, batteries, motors) must be protected from dust, moisture, chemicals, and physical damage. IP (Ingress Protection) ratings like IP55 or higher are essential for electrical enclosures [4].
        *   Sealed bearings, corrosion-resistant coatings, and robust wiring harnesses are necessary for longevity in muddy, wet, or corrosive environments [2, 4].
    *   **Vibration Mitigation:** Rubber-isolated mounts for engines/motors, batteries, and control units can reduce the impact of vibrations, extending component life and aligning with targets like a 10-year lifespan mentioned in some design studies [4].
    *   **Modular Design for Repairability:** A modular design, as seen in the CAKE Kibb, where components can be easily replaced, can enhance durability by simplifying repairs and reducing downtime [3].

### B. Trade-offs Between Drive Systems

| Drive System   | Advantages                                       | Trade-offs                                                              | Typical Use Cases for Mini-Tractors                               |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **2WD (Two-Wheel Drive)** | Simpler design, lower cost, lighter weight, potentially more energy efficient on flat ground [4]. | Reduced traction on slopes, wet/muddy conditions; less maneuverable in tight spots than skid-steer. | Light-duty tasks on flat or gently undulating terrain, cost-sensitive applications. |
| **4WD (Four-Wheel Drive)** | Superior traction on varied terrain (slopes, mud, loose soil), better stability [4 - inferred benefit]. | Higher cost, increased weight, potentially higher energy consumption, more complex drivetrain. | Operations on hilly terrain, tasks requiring significant pulling power, all-weather capability. Monarch Tractor uses 4WD with AI-driven torque vectoring [2]. |
| **Skid-Steer**   | Zero or very small turning radius, excellent maneuverability in confined spaces [3]. | Can cause soil compaction and turf damage during turns, potentially less stable on steep slopes, can be less efficient for straight-line travel. | Greenhouses, orchards, vineyards, tasks requiring frequent sharp turns. CAKE Kibb utilizes this [3]. |
| **Tracked System** | Low ground pressure (reduced soil compaction), excellent traction in soft/muddy conditions. | Higher cost, more complex, slower speeds, potential for higher maintenance. | Very soft or sensitive soils, specialized applications. (Not explicitly in sources for mini-tractors but a general option). |

Electric motors, common in autonomous mini-tractors, offer instant torque which benefits all drive systems, particularly in variable traction conditions. They also have fewer moving parts than combustion engines, potentially increasing durability and reducing maintenance of the power unit itself.

### C. Suitable Materials and Construction Techniques

*   **Frame Materials:**
    *   **Steel (e.g., High-Strength Low-Alloy - HSLA):** Offers excellent strength, durability, and impact resistance. Relatively easy to weld and repair. Prone to corrosion if not properly treated (e.g., powder coating, galvanization). Often chosen for its cost-effectiveness.
    *   **Aluminum Alloys:** Lighter weight than steel, which can improve energy efficiency and reduce soil compaction. Good corrosion resistance. More expensive than steel and can be more challenging to weld/repair. CAKE Kibb uses a lightweight aluminum frame [3].
*   **Body Panels / Enclosures:**
    *   **Impact-Resistant Plastics (e.g., ABS, Polycarbonate):** Lightweight, can be molded into complex shapes, good corrosion resistance. May not be as durable as metal in very harsh conditions.
    *   **Sheet Metal (Steel or Aluminum):** More durable against physical impacts.
*   **Construction Techniques:**
    *   **Welding:** Provides strong, permanent joints. Good for primary frame structures.
    *   **Bolted Assemblies:** Allows for modularity and easier replacement of damaged components, as highlighted by CAKE's design philosophy [3]. Requires proper torque and locking mechanisms to prevent loosening due to vibrations.
    *   **Sealing and Gasketing:** Crucial for all enclosures housing electronics, batteries, and motors to achieve IP ratings like IP55 or higher, protecting against dust and water ingress [4].
*   **Cost-Performance Balance:**
    *   The QFD analysis in one study prioritized manufacturing cost (targeting R$55,000, approx. USD 10,000-11,000), indicating a need for cost-effective material choices and manufacturing processes without overly compromising durability and a target lifespan of ≥10 years [4].
    *   Monarch Tractor’s approach of A/B testing hardware components for performance and cost also reflects this balance [2].

### D. Examples from Research

*   **Monarch Tractor:** Employs a 4WD electric system with AI-driven capabilities and a hydraulic-by-wire platform, suggesting a focus on robust performance and precision suitable for varied farm tasks [2].
*   **CAKE Kibb:** Features a modular, lightweight aluminum frame with a skid-steer system, designed for minimal soil disturbance and adaptability in applications like regenerative agriculture [3]. Its design emphasizes ease of repair and component swapping.
*   **QFD-based Design Study:** A study focusing on a mini-tractor for family farming highlighted design specifications like adjustable track width, turning radius, IP55 protection, and a 10-year lifespan, all while targeting a specific manufacturing cost, demonstrating the multi-faceted optimization required [4].

The design of an autonomous electric mini-tractor platform is a complex interplay of achieving stability for sensor performance and safety, maneuverability for operational efficiency in diverse farm layouts, and durability to ensure a long service life with manageable maintenance in challenging agricultural conditions.
