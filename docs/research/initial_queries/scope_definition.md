# Research Scope Definition for Project Sevak

## 1. Project Overview

This research focuses on "Sevak," an autonomous electric mini-tractor designed for fodder cutting and transport. The project aims to develop a vehicle capable of performing these agricultural tasks with minimal human intervention.

## 2. Core Functionalities to Investigate

The research will cover technologies, challenges, existing solutions, and market considerations related to the following core functionalities as defined in the project blueprint:

*   **Autonomous Operation:**
    *   Navigation and path planning for fodder cutting within defined areas.
    *   Autonomous transport of cut fodder to designated drop-off points.
    *   Return to a home base.
*   **Fodder Cutting Mechanism:**
    *   Technologies suitable for an autonomous electric mini-tractor.
    *   Efficiency, power consumption, and maintenance aspects.
*   **Electric Powertrain:**
    *   Battery technology (capacity, charging, lifespan).
    *   Electric motor and drivetrain suitable for agricultural terrain and tasks.
    *   Energy efficiency and operational range.
*   **Task Management System:**
    *   Map-based interface for defining operational areas (cutting, drop-off, home base).
    *   User interface (UI) and user experience (UX) considerations for farm operators.
*   **Manual Control:**
    *   Remote manual control system (e.g., virtual joystick via a connected device).
    *   Safety and reliability of manual override.
*   **Obstacle Avoidance:**
    *   Sensor fusion (GPS, cameras, potentially others like LiDAR or ultrasonic).
    *   Algorithms for recognizing and avoiding obstacles, with a specific focus on animals and common farm obstacles.
    *   Safety protocols and fail-safe mechanisms.
*   **Data Logging and Farm Management Insights:**
    *   Logging of operational data (e.g., hours worked, area covered, errors, yield estimates if feasible).
    *   Potential for data analysis to provide insights for farm management.
    *   Connectivity and data storage solutions.
*   **Mini-Tractor Platform:**
    *   Chassis design, suspension, and maneuverability suitable for a "mini-tractor" form factor.
    *   Durability and robustness for agricultural environments.

## 3. Key Research Areas

The research will delve into:

*   **Enabling Technologies:** Specific hardware (sensors, actuators, compute units, cutting systems, batteries) and software (AI/ML algorithms for perception and navigation, control systems, fleet management if applicable).
*   **Potential Challenges:** Technical hurdles (e.g., GPS accuracy in challenging environments, sensor performance in dust/rain, battery life), operational challenges (e.g., varied terrain, unpredictable obstacles), safety and regulatory considerations, cost-effectiveness, and user adoption.
*   **Existing Solutions & Competitors:** Analysis of current autonomous agricultural vehicles, fodder cutting technologies, and related systems. Identification of key players and their technological approaches.
*   **Market Considerations:** Target market segments, potential market size, value proposition for farmers, pricing strategies, and go-to-market considerations.

## 4. Exclusions (Initial Scope)

While related, the following areas are initially considered out of scope unless specific findings indicate their critical importance:

*   Detailed financial modeling beyond general cost-effectiveness.
*   In-depth agronomy related to fodder quality (focus is on cutting and transport).
*   Manufacturing process design.
*   Advanced fleet management of multiple Sevak units (though basic multi-unit coordination might be touched upon if relevant to core autonomy).

This scope will guide the initial data collection and analysis phases. It may be refined as new information emerges and knowledge gaps are identified.
