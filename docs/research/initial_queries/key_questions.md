## 4. Task Management System & UI/UX

*   What are best practices for designing intuitive map-based interfaces for defining agricultural tasks (cutting areas, paths, zones)?
*   How can the UI effectively display essential information (tractor status, battery, location) for clear and quick understanding by farm operators, considering outdoor use?
*   What are the key UX considerations for ensuring ease of use and adoption by farmers who may not be tech-savvy?

## 5. Manual Control System

*   What are reliable and responsive technologies for implementing remote manual control (e.g., virtual joystick, dedicated hardware controller)?
*   What are the critical safety features and fail-safes required for a manual override system in an autonomous vehicle?
*   How can seamless switching between autonomous and manual modes be ensured?

## 6. Obstacle Avoidance

*   What are the most effective sensor fusion strategies (GPS, cameras, LiDAR, ultrasonic, etc.) for robust obstacle detection and avoidance in dynamic farm environments, especially for animals?
*   What AI/ML algorithms are SOTA for object recognition (animals, people, farm equipment, terrain features) from sensor data?
*   How can the system differentiate between traversable vegetation (fodder) and non-traversable obstacles?
*   What are the performance limitations of current obstacle avoidance systems in adverse conditions (dust, rain, low light)?

## 7. Data Logging & Farm Management Insights

*   What types of operational data are most valuable for farm management insights (e.g., area covered, time taken, energy consumed, error rates, potential yield indicators)?
*   What are suitable and cost-effective methods for data logging, storage, and potential cloud connectivity for Sevak?
*   How can logged data be presented to farmers in a useful and actionable format?

## 8. Mini-Tractor Platform Design

*   What are the key design considerations for a "mini-tractor" chassis to ensure stability, maneuverability, and durability on varied agricultural terrain?
*   What are the trade-offs between different drive systems (e.g., 2WD, 4WD, skid-steer) for this application?
*   What materials and construction techniques are best suited for longevity in harsh farm environments?

## 9. Existing Solutions & Market Landscape

*   Who are the key players and what are the existing commercial or research solutions for autonomous agricultural vehicles, particularly for fodder management or similar tasks?
*   What are the strengths and weaknesses of these existing solutions?
*   What is the current market adoption rate for autonomous agricultural technology, and what are the primary drivers and barriers?
*   What are the typical price points and value propositions for comparable systems?

## 10. Challenges & Risks

*   What are the primary technical, operational, safety, and regulatory challenges anticipated for the development and deployment of Sevak?
*   What are the potential environmental impacts (positive or negative) to consider?
*   How can the system be designed for reliability and ease of maintenance by farmers?
*   What are the cost implications of different technology choices, and how can cost-effectiveness be achieved?
