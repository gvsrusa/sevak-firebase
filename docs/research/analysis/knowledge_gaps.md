# Identified Knowledge Gaps and Areas for Further Research

This document identifies unanswered questions, areas lacking sufficient detail, and emergent topics that require further targeted research to fully inform Project Sevak. This list will drive subsequent research cycles.

*(This section will be populated after a thorough analysis of all collected data and initial analysis documents: `expert_insights.md`, `identified_patterns.md`, and `contradictions.md`.)*

## 1. Gaps in Technological Details

*   **(Placeholder)** e.g., Specific performance benchmarks (accuracy, processing time, failure rates) for AI/ML algorithms used in differentiating traversable fodder from complex non-traversable obstacles (e.g., partially hidden rocks, tangled wire) in diverse field conditions.
    *   *Current understanding:* General approaches (spectral analysis, LiDAR intensity, 3D structure) are known.
    *   *Needed:* Quantitative data on reliability and limitations.
*   **(Placeholder)** e.g., Detailed cost-benefit analysis and long-term maintenance requirements for different types of fodder cutting mechanisms when integrated into an autonomous electric platform.
*   **(Placeholder)** e.g., Comparative data on the real-world energy consumption of different electric mini-tractor drive systems (2WD vs. 4WD vs. skid-steer) specifically for fodder cutting and transport cycles on varied terrains.

## 2. Gaps in Market and Adoption Specifics

*   **(Placeholder)** e.g., Specific market size and adoption projections for *autonomous fodder management solutions* (not just general AAVs) in key agricultural regions.
*   **(Placeholder)** e.g., In-depth case studies or farmer testimonials on the ROI and operational challenges of using *small to medium-sized* autonomous electric tractors for tasks similar to Sevak's.
*   **(Placeholder)** e.g., Detailed analysis of the competitive landscape for mini-tractors with autonomous fodder cutting capabilities – identifying direct and indirect competitors and their specific offerings/price points.

## 3. Gaps in Operational and Implementation Details

*   **(Placeholder)** e.g., Best practices for on-farm charging infrastructure deployment for a fleet of electric mini-tractors, considering grid limitations in rural areas and solar integration feasibility.
*   **(Placeholder)** e.g., Specific training curriculum requirements and time investment for farmers to become proficient in operating and maintaining a system like Sevak.
*   **(Placeholder)** e.g., Data on the typical failure modes and mean time between failures (MTBF) for critical components in autonomous agricultural robots operating in similar environments.

## 4. Gaps in Regulatory and Safety Standards

*   **(Placeholder)** e.g., Current status and anticipated timelines for specific safety standards or certifications applicable to autonomous mini-tractors performing cutting operations in regions relevant to Sevak.
*   **(Placeholder)** e.g., Established legal precedents or frameworks for assigning liability in incidents involving autonomous agricultural machinery.

## 5. Gaps Related to User Blueprint Specifics

*   **(Placeholder)** e.g., Further research into obstacle avoidance specifically for "animals" as mentioned in the blueprint – what are the SOTA detection and response strategies for different types of farm animals (cattle, sheep, dogs, etc.)?
*   **(Placeholder)** e.g., More detailed information on data logging for "farm management insights" – what specific insights are most valued by farmers managing fodder operations, and how can these be derived from Sevak's logged data?

Each identified knowledge gap will be prioritized, and targeted research queries will be formulated to address them in subsequent research cycles, if permitted by operational constraints.
